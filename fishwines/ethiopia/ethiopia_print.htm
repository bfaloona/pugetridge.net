            January 16 - Addis Ababa (Paul)</b><br>
            I always imagined that to be human meant, at the core, waking up and 
            deciding what to do. For many of us, things are more routine and maybe 
            not so conscious as &quot;deciding.&quot; Many, I'm sure, feel stuck 
            without choices, but ultimately, despite the risks and consequences, 
            I thought, each person has choices, which come from hopes, and dreams&#133; 
            Today, this was shattered. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We arrived in Addis on Wednesday evening and 
            have seen some of the city, with its wide streets and what seems, 
            after Karachi, to be a large amount of green. But everywhere we go, 
            we see extreme poverty. Sidewalks lined with people who have nothing 
            and are doing nothing. Makeshift tarps covering cardboard to sleep 
            on. People, children, sprawled out sleeping in medians along main 
            streets in the mid-day sun with cars going by. Today I walked several 
            miles to the bus station and back through what is said to be the largest 
            market area in Africa. There were shops of all kinds but there were 
            thousands of people just standing, sitting, doing nothing. Not everyone 
            looked destitute. There were well-dressed middle class people as well 
            as a share of nice cars in the streets, but the shear magnitude of 
            the poverty, the number of people and especially kids sleeping on 
            the road edge. What could life be like? I can't make sense of it. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Returning to the haven of this $17/night hotel 
            with its wall and armed guards, I came into our room and cried. It 
            feels like a whole people have been robbed of their humanity. I admit 
            that I couldn't see agony and suffering. In some, I saw quite a bit 
            of life - smiles, joking, industriousness, and friendship. I saw struggle 
            and I also saw a kind of living deadness, where I wonder if there 
            is even pain anymore. Right now, the people of Addis, many of them, 
            are going to sleep. What is that like? What will they dream about? 
            What can they think about tomorrow?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Wednesday, January 15 - Addis Ababa (Barbara)</b><br>
            We have arrived in Ethiopia with not enough money - na&iuml;ve travelers 
            thinking that bankcards and computers work everywhere. 5 months of 
            traveling gone and we still confront our naivety! We have emailed 
            Jane to send us some cash - thank heavens for family!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We see poverty here at a level I can't even 
            conceive of addressing. Cardboard and tin shacks, dirt floors, plastic 
            roofs. Children running everywhere, ragged clothes, bare feet &amp; 
            hungry. I know that I can't buy enough food to feed them all and even 
            then it would be only one meal in a lifetime. One meal and a stomach 
            that is hungry tomorrow. None of this is new, but it is new for me. 
            I won't enter the lane between the cardboard houses - I am afraid 
            to - afraid that I am guilty - not of creating it, but just of being 
            there in my health and with my full stomach. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Thursday, January 16 - Addis Ababa (Barbara)</b><br>
            I've wondered if we shouldn't have come - should have stayed in Kenya. 
            Have tried not to think too much about that until we get out of this 
            city &amp; see life in a smaller town. Went to pick up the money Jane 
            sent this morning. Walking back to meet Paul &amp; AJ at the Internet 
            place (with $1000 in my money belt), so many kids stopped me asking 
            for money, so many mothers with babies. And all of them, I look away, 
            say no. I hate the cruelty of it, but I don't know what the option 
            is. One of them, one mother with 2 kids, made the voices scream in 
            my head with the sadness of it all and I almost broke down crying. 
            And still I said no, and part of me is ashamed of that. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Friday, January 17 - Addis Ababa (Paul)</b><br>
            We are on the bus! Yesterday, I was told that the bus to Bahar Dar 
            was full. One bus a day. I was told to come back at 6 am to buy a 
            ticket for Saturday. The bus station is a chaotic mess. Many people 
            sitting, standing, laying about. Buildings and shacks with what look 
            like ticket windows all over the sprawling station. After Turkey, 
            where there are so many private bus companies, I wondered if I needed 
            to keep looking around for other bus options. After several tries, 
            I gave up, thinking there really might only be one bus a day in the 
            direction of Bahar Dar. The guy at the hotel said they would send 
            Melaku to buy tickets for us for 75 birr ($9) instead of 58 ($7) but 
            he was also unable.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We decided to set up a taxi and meet Melaku 
            with our packs at the bus station at 5:30 in the morning to try and 
            get on the bus. If not, we could buy tickets for Saturday. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">It's pitch black as we head to the bus station 
            in the taxi and the streets are surprisingly quiet. Our street is 
            empty save the lone dog picking through garbage on the side of the 
            road. We drove through the market area. A few people are sweeping 
            the street in front of shops. Others have been swept. I'm amazed at 
            this care amid the garbage and mess I saw the day before. Elsewhere, 
            homeless people in rows sleep under covered porches. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">As we near, we can see people walking to the 
            bus station and soon, we're engulfed in people. The gates of the station 
            are still locked and thousands of people are walking, carrying, pushing, 
            wanting to get in. We are standing with the taxi driver looking for 
            Melaku, hoping the cab driver knows him. It's 5:20. 5:30. 5:40. No 
            Melaku. The taxi driver doesn't speak English as we wander through 
            the gates asking him to try and buy tickets for us - find someone 
            who would agree to go tomorrow, for a prices, so we could go today. 
            We've been told it's especially crowded because it's Epiphany here 
            in this Christian Orthodox country - &quot;Timket Bale&quot;' in Amharek.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Standing in the darkness, surrounded by a bustle 
            of Ethiopians from all walks, in the midst of rows of busses, with 
            the taxi driver not understanding us, I began to doubt we would even 
            be able to buy tickets for tomorrow. Surprisingly, I was not scared. 
            It felt strangely calm despite the crowd and the chaos.</font></p>
          <p> <font color="#333333">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; came a voice. 
            &quot;Bahar Dar.&quot; A young man, maybe 30, he said his job was 
            to control the bus station and he would help us. Sometimes, he said, 
            there was a 3rd or 4th bus that would come after an hour or so. So 
            far the 2 busses were full. I believed him. At the very least, he 
            spoke English. I paid the taxi driver, counting out 27 birr while 
            Annie shined the flashlight ($3 including a tip). So we stood, together, 
            waiting. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">He came back and told us to follow him. Snaking 
            through the crowd holding hands, we made our way over to where the 
            2 Bahar Dar busses stood and bought us three tickets - regular price. 
            We were going to go today! Now we have tickets. More waiting as the 
            sun begins to brighten the sky and backlight the men standing atop 
            the many busses loading or loaded, the crowd of people waiting and, 
            Melaku - just arrived. I recognized him from the hotel the day before.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Even though we had our tickets, having him 
            wait with us boosted my confidence that we would make it into the 
            bus. An hour or so, we waited. The sun came up, we took off our packs, 
            and Barbara took a few pictures, aware of the risk and despite the 
            many people staring. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">The two Bahar Dar buses left. Then, the bus 
            controller came and told us to follow him again. Snaking again, through 
            the crowd, he led us to our bus. Barbara and Annie got in line and 
            I waiting with the packs with others to load baggage on top of the 
            bus. When the collector came to me he lifted the packs and asked for 
            30 birr ($3.60) to load them. We had earlier met a French guy who 
            said he paid 5 birr for his pack. &quot;5 birr,&quot; I said. &quot;25&quot; 
            &quot;5 each,&quot; I said. &quot;25.&quot; &quot;15,&quot; I replied. 
            He walked away. Then I caught the bus controller again and asked him 
            to help. Back and forth in Amharek. &quot;20&quot; he said and came 
            back over. I said &quot;18&quot; counting out the money. He nodded 
            and wrote out a receipt. I hefted the packs up and joined Barbara 
            and AJ in line. In a few minutes, the line began to move and we all 
            walked around the bus and into the chaos of people and stuff inside. 
            Me first, Barbara last and Annie in the middle. Somehow, Melaku had 
            gotten on the bus ahead of us and was saving us seats near the front. 
            The driver, he said, was his best friend and before he left, brought 
            him over to meet us: Tommesgel.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Now, a few minutes after leaving the Addis 
            bus station, we are driving on a beautiful paved road (I don't know 
            how long this will last) through the rural countryside of Ethiopia: 
            stone walls, cultivated fields, thatched roof houses, barefooted young 
            men walking cows. The open space a stark and amazing contrast to what 
            we just left in Addis Ababa and the bus station.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Tuesday, January 21 - Gondar (Barbara)</b><br>
            I continue to struggle with our place here in Ethiopia. It is partly 
            the poverty and destitution of people here - our painful confrontation 
            with hunger, dirt, flies, deformities (where did they all come from 
            - is this just hidden in the US, or does this abundance of deformities 
            come from bad diets, or some bad drugs taken during pregnancy, or 
            what?), rags for clothes, feet turned backward, stubs for arms, limbs 
            missing, blind and crippled, all with hands outstretched &quot;money, 
            money&quot; kids alone, 3 or 4 years old, and each blind one has a 
            &quot;helper&quot; who surely gets a cut, &quot;mother, mother, money, 
            money&quot; &quot;you, you&quot; (Who, me? Me? Yes, &quot;you, you!&quot;) 
            Mothers with babies, &quot;Food, food, hungry, hungry.&quot; Gathered 
            fingers point to mouth, little hand rubs a stomach, rows and rows 
            of cardboard houses, stretch on and on and on. I wonder where are 
            the toilets - the simple fact of shit confronts me and I think with 
            all this shit around, it surely must not be as filthy as my culture 
            has raised me to believe. Where does all the shit go? I am obsessed 
            with it - all this foreign shit and my own. Where will I shit if I 
            need too? I judge each hotel room, not by the bed (don't even think 
            about the view) but where can I shit if I need to and how much of 
            someone else's shit do I have to deal with. Or equally the smell of 
            piss - it angers me, that strong whiff of piss, like someone's hand 
            reached out to slap me as I walk down the street. And scares me a 
            bit. Places with piss are scary, dangerous places; men who piss in 
            the street are not to be trusted. Old, things I heard in childhood. 
            Old fears jump up and my whole body recoils from the slap of the piss 
            smell. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Wednesday, January 22 - Gondar (Paul)</b><br>
            Hey young man, English pretty good, looking to show us around for 
            tips;<br>
            Hey old woman with no shoes, feet covered with sores, missing teeth, 
            white clothes turned brown;<br>
            Hey almost naked two year old, already learned to yell, &quot;Mister&quot; 
            or &quot;you, you, you!&quot;<br>
            Hey you, legs all deformed, scooting down the gravel on your hands 
            and knees calling after me:<br>
            Hey old man, bent over and blind, shaking your outstretched hand at 
            the air in my direction;<br>
            Hey little boy, trying to get me to buy some gum or crackers, tissue 
            or cigarettes&#133;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I see you all, as much as I can really look. 
            What makes you keep on?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I feel bad for you. Why has God put us together 
            today? Do you want my life? Today, we breathe the same air and live 
            in the same moment. Tonight we will sleep, tomorrow, wake. Is that 
            where it ends? Tell me what it's like to live in your pain. Seeing 
            you makes me appreciate my life, my body. I think. It confuses me. 
            Why was I born me and you born you? Is this all a problem? Does hunger 
            and pain pull you closer to God? Is life more precious when you've 
            seen people starve? Do you hate yourself? Me? God? Does your answer 
            change if I give you money? Or not? Do you appreciate the stars, the 
            sunrise, feel joy or love? As well as sadness and fear? Can this get 
            better? Is there a right answer. Am I part of the problem? Does it 
            hurt all the time or just some of the time. Or can't you fell at all 
            anymore? Do you cry? What do you think about when you lay down at 
            night and the day goes quiet?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Friday, January 24 - Gondar (Annie)</b><br>
            I got a chain finally. I have been wanting one to make an anklet out 
            of since Pakistan. It was 5 birr. I keep thinking that is a lot but 
            it is less than $1! I think it is used for holding your wallet. (This 
            pen is broken. The tip bends).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Tonight, I played games with the kids. One 
            you ran around in a circle, one person saying, &quot;go around, go 
            around, go around.&quot; Then when they say: &quot;sit,&quot; you 
            sit, &quot;stop,&quot; you stop. They can yell sit and keep going 
            but you must sit - like Simon Says. These people are very active. 
            I have a blister on my toe. It hurts.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Today we did e-mail. I found out how to make 
            a cat:<br>
            &gt;Y&lt;<br>
            * *<br>

          <p><font color="#333333">I can't wait to get my pack so I can make my 
            anklet! I have some bites on my feet and they spread. They itch too. 
            By Dose is runny. Maybe from the heat, maybe from the dust. I don't 
            know. It fills up and I have to run for a tissue. Ugh!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I hope my blister goes away soon! It hurts. 
            I'm tired. I think I'll go to sleep. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Friday, January 24 - Gondar</b><br>
            Today, something flipped inside me. Until now, Ethiopia has been hard 
            to swallow. As tourists, we are accosted by beggars flaunting their 
            wounds and the extremity of their poverty or pushing us to take them 
            with us for tips. Now, though, after two days with Tekeba's family, 
            we are home. Annie, fabricating her cat toy to play with the Kitties, 
            or now, late in the evening, playing games with the 10 or so kids 
            living here - like Cohousing - in the courtyard. And we, receiving 
            a coffee ceremony - Abol, Tona, Baraka - the three cups of coffee 
            with Injera dinner between Abol and Tona, having conversations about 
            religion and community in the courtyard as well with some nursing 
            students who rent some of the courtyard rooms for 70 birr (about 8$) 
            per month.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Christian Orthodoxy and family are important 
            here and although extreme poverty are stretching people to the breaking 
            point, the cultural foundation and economic isolation of Ethiopia 
            hold things together. 85% of Ethiopians are subsistence farmers, 15% 
            are urban. Half the population is under 16 and unemployment is epidemic. 
            With so many young people, no jobs, and school likely to lead nowhere, 
            I would expect to see much more crime, violence, drug addiction, alcoholism, 
            etc. But while it would be na&iuml;ve to think that these problems 
            don't exist, we haven't seen them.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Here in this house, there is almost no adult 
            supervision of the kids - aged 4 and up. They do help fetch water, 
            wash dishes and this with and that but for the most part, the days 
            are spent hanging around the house. We haven't figured out the school 
            schedule yet, sometimes mornings, sometimes afternoons, some days 
            not at all, but it seems fairly unimportant. Yet, the kids are really 
            well behaved and get along very well together: no fighting, no mistreatment 
            or making fun.<br>
            Annie and I also played basketball at a nice outdoor court at the 
            local college and there's none of the &quot;attitude&quot; that you 
            see at the community center or the Y sometimes in Seattle.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Life here is very basic. There is no running 
            water, a pit toilet serves the whole courtyard (about 20-25 people) 
            the walls of the house are made of wood covered in mud or dung mixed 
            with straw - painted. Tin roof and dirt floor, our room is covered 
            with straw mats. Cooking is done over charcoal in a small portable 
            ceramic grill - like a hibachi. Everyone wears the same cloths every 
            day. Tonight, the TV was on for a few hours but last night, the electricity 
            was out.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">And once again, we find, behind the front line 
            of beggars, behind the backdrop of material poverty, there are incredibly 
            kind and generous people waking up each morning and living their lives 
            - being kind to each other and doing the best they can with what they've 
            got.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We have been invited into this family because 
            of my friendship with Tekeba in Seattle and they've taken such care 
            to see that we are comfortable and happy. But I've sensed that even 
            such a connection is not necessary. Whenever we have said to people 
            &quot; we want to know you&quot; and then stuck around to do that, 
            people have responded with &quot;we want to be known.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We obviously don't belong in Ethiopia. This 
            group of young boys has reminded us each time we head up the hill 
            to this house, yelling &quot;Firenge, Firenge&#133;&quot; (White man, 
            White man). We're stared at, followed and approached on the street, 
            often yelled at and solicited for money or pens and all of that is 
            hard.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I so much miss hanging out with my friends 
            and family, speaking my own language. Belonging has always been a 
            big deal for me and I don't imagine I will come to that feeling very 
            deeply here, but it's so clear to me that language, customs and material 
            comfort don't separate us from each other in any real or fundamental 
            way. Half way into this trip, I'm convinced that people want to connect, 
            to be with each other, to treat each other well and be well treated.

          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Friday, January 24 - Gondar (Barbara)</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I focus in on the small things; Paul pulls 
            back for the larger landscape. That's who we are - it's a contrast 
            (or balance) that has followed us into this trip.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">I catch one woman throwing a basket of beans 
            in the air to separate the shell from the seeds, ancient movement, 
            ancient work. Beans in mid air, the colors of her scarf, weave of 
            the basket, the pile of beans already done, expression on her face, 
            taut muscles of her arms, bean dusted hands, straightness of her back, 
            women's work. </font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Paul captures the courtyard itself, how there 
            are really two women at this work, facing each other, sun-dried earth 
            walls surround them, partly painted green and tan, corrugated metal 
            shutter, yellow plastic water jug to carry water from the public faucet, 
            green plastic wash basin, a stack of fire wood, smoke from an unseen 
            fire, today's laundry on the line, coffee can planter, chicken strutting 
            about and maybe even a baby chick or two if you look closely. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Our visions are compatible - each telling a 
            story with a slightly different focus, that build on each other, back 
            and forth, the narrow and the wide angle - each a tale of this courtyard's 
            life. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">But there's more not shown. To the left just 
            out of the picture, three other women are listening to a soap opera 
            on the radio, one of them cross-stitching a tablecloth, one cleaning 
            her nails, one just listening. They're nurses in training living in 
            the one-room dormitories around the courtyard, far from home and family. 
            Mixing with the radio, sounds of crickets and the chickens, and laughter 
            of children, running in and out, jumping rope, playing. Older kids 
            doing small chores - bringing water, chopping wood. The cat of course 
            slinks through periodically, ignoring the chickens. Smells too evade 
            the photo - smoke from the fire, rich smell of spices from cooking 
            in the adjacent kitchen, whiff of the pit toilet. And a cool breeze 
            spites the hot sun that bakes this earthen floor. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Wednesday, January 29 - Debebuhar (Paul)</b><br>
            I can't believe where we are! Starting in Addis, Ethiopia's sprawling 
            capital city, we have worked our way through Bahar Dar and Gondar 
            to this village of about 2,000 people (my guess). This is the way 
            85% - 40 million people in Ethiopia live: dirt floors, no electricity 
            or running water, the bathroom: out in the field. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We are staying with &quot;Kesi Admasi&quot; 
            a local priest who people have said is like the father of the people 
            in this village. He is rich for this place and has an amazing air 
            about him. Walking the paths through the village, people approach 
            him, kiss his feet and knees and the carved wooden Christian Orthodox 
            cross that he carries in his pocket. He is Tekeba's uncle, my friend 
            in Seattle who pointed the way for us on this Ethiopian leg of our 
            journey. They have borrowed 2 beds to make us comfortable in their 
            home - one made of cowhide strips stretched over a wooden frame, the 
            other metal with a thin cloth mattress. The family doesn't speak English 
            and so in our first few days, we haven't known what is happening from 
            moment to moment.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">The day we arrived, we were brought into a 
            building on the main street which we later learned was a coffee shop 
            and clearly one of the village hangouts. We were fed, coffee ceremony 
            and attracted a large crowd of people curious about these Ferengies, 
            perhaps the first to stay in Debebuhar. Just walking down Dubebuhar's 
            main dirt road (Ethiopia's main north-south road) we attract a crowd 
            of mostly young people 20-25 strong. Some can say &quot;where are 
            you go?&quot; or &quot;Hello.&quot; They are not begging as they did 
            in the cities, just curious and with nothing to do.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">After a few hours of just hanging out, we were 
            walked through the woods to the Admasi family home, two wood/cow dung 
            structures. One round with a grass roof, one rectangular with tin. 
            We've spent all of our time in the rectangular house - two rooms, 
            dirt floor, and candle at night. The walls are lined with benches 
            built into the walls and covered with animal skins and woven grass 
            mats. Hand washing before each meal is done by pouring water over 
            your hands and onto the floor (0% humidity, you can watch it dry up). 
            There are several people in the family and we're having trouble learning 
            names and relations - Kesi Admasi and his wife, 5 or 6 kids from about 
            9-15 years old, a young women with a baby on her back and many others 
            in and out. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Grinding flour by stone, weaving grass baskets, 
            making cotton thread by drop spindle, cooking by charcoal&#133;life 
            for us here is strictly watching and waiting to be directed what to 
            do. Food - so much food - is given to us and it's difficult to each 
            as much as they want us to. &quot;Ble, Ble, Blu&quot; they say over 
            and over as we try hard to gesture, the English-Amharek dictionary: 
            &quot;enough&quot; and &quot;full&quot; and &quot;thank you, no&quot; 
            None of it works. Only after we absolutely finish do they gather around 
            to eat: Injera and wat (meat or bean sauce), bread, honey&#133; </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Late into the night it seemed, long after dark, 
            we sat, ate, watched, listened to their Amharek language and the crickets 
            outside. Then, several times, I tried, &quot;Tired,&quot; &quot;rest&quot; 
            &quot;sleep now.&quot; But we just sat, waiting, watching, listening. 
            Finally, our beds were brought in, made up and we went to bed, Barbara 
            and Annie and I in bed, 2 girls, the young mother and her baby on 
            the benching along the walls, Kesi Admasi and his wife in their bed 
            in the other of the two rooms in the house and four boys in a tree 
            house outside.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">There are several cows wandering around the 
            house, a few dogs, oxen, donkey and the land is strikingly beautiful. 
            A few hundred yards from the house there is an incredible canyon that 
            stretches as far as you can see. And people walk: thin, long-legged 
            Ethiopian farmers, slowly, deliberately, with their walking sticks, 
            white shawls, moving their animals and heading home.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Thursday, January 30 - Debebuhar (Paul)</b><br>
            We're still waiting for our &quot;hearing.&quot; We've been sitting 
            here for a while, waiting. Everyone is staring at me now and it got 
            really quiet when I picked up the pen and started writing. Three priests 
            including Kesi Admasi (you can tell by the head wrap), some of Tekeba's 
            sisters, an old blind woman and several kids. We're in one of Tekeba's 
            sisters' houses, presumably where our hearing will take place. But 
            who knows. This morning, around 9 am, after breakfast, we were led 
            to the coffee house for coffee (we thought, the hearing). We waited 
            a few hours. Watched a goat slaughter in front of the coffee house. 
            Annie pulled the raw cotton she'd picked up yesterday out of her pocket 
            and after playing with it for a minute; a girl brought out her drop 
            spindle and gave Annie some more cotton. After an hour, she'd gotten 
            the hang of it and manufactured several yards of thread on the spindle.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">- Break - </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We were just served scrambled eggs with raw 
            garlic on Injera while everyone watched us eat. No one else ate. Now 
            the coffee beans are being washed - the first step of the coffee ceremony 
            that includes washing, roasting, bringing to us to smell, grinding 
            by hand in a wooden cup with, usually an old metal car part, mixing 
            the coffee with water, brewing and pouring from 12 inches high or 
            so into the small cups with sugar. The process is repeated three times 
            and usually takes about 2 hours. Another spindle is coming out for 
            Annie. I'm beginning to wonder if this isn't just &quot;meet the family.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">But last night, after we attended a small celebration 
            for Mother Mary (known as Miriam here), we were met outside by Kesi 
            Admasi and the English teacher. &quot;Some people are cheating,&quot; 
            she said. While her English seems pretty good, we've already had quite 
            a bit of trouble communicating clearly with her. As we could get, 
            some people are upset about us going into the church yesterday and 
            wondering why we are here. Kesi Admasi had invited us to come to church 
            and we had walked into town and up the steep trail to the church. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We thought we were somewhat prepared because 
            Barbara and I had gone to church in Gondar: the historic Debre Birhan 
            Selasie Church. It was an amazing experience. Arriving at the church 
            at dawn, you can hear the chanting and the bells of the worshiping 
            inside the church: a round, stone, stick, mud and straw building with 
            a huge stone porch surrounded by large old Eucalyptus trees all set 
            inside a stone wall. Covered in white, men on one side women on the 
            other, people entered the gates, stood among the trees, leaned against 
            the wall, sat on the stones, stood on the porch, hugged the doorways 
            and huddled against the walls of the church. Periodically, priests 
            would come out and willing worshipers would enter the church to join 
            the chanting inside. Barbara and I spent over an hour inside in silent 
            meditation, drawn into the spiritual other-worldliness of the chanting, 
            the darkness and the presence of worship.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">As we approached the Debebuhar church yesterday, 
            the scene was the same - eerie, serene, and solemn. We could hear 
            similar chanting and drumming and from just inside the wall surrounding 
            the church grounds, I could see Kesi Admasi inside, through the church 
            window. Barbara had entered the church grounds through the women's 
            entrance and was already in the church. I stood for a long time just 
            inside the gate, reluctant to approach the church because, already, 
            people were staring at me. But Kesi Admasi had invited us and I was 
            drawn, more by a sense of obligation than by curiosity or the desire 
            to pray. I went up to the steps and noticed that Kesi Admasi had come 
            out to get me. He brought me over to where Barbara and the English 
            teacher were standing. The worshiping continued as the English Teacher 
            explained that Kesi Admasi wanted us to see and photograph the damage 
            that rats were doing to the precious paintings of the church. Barbara 
            was reluctant but begged on and we were circled through the church 
            inside and out, weaving through the worshipers lining the walls, sitting 
            and standing throughout, taking picture. It was almost funny to us 
            at the time as, over and over, we were told that it was not a disruption. 
            &quot;No problem, they are voluntary.&quot; Finally, we were told 
            to wait outside in the grass until they were finished, when the whole 
            congregation came out to be photographed.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Apparently though, partly because of this and 
            maybe our high profile presence in Debebuhar, living with Kesi Admasi, 
            teaching a few days in the school&#133;some people were not happy 
            about a Jew being in the church and were wondering what was the purpose 
            of our staying in Debebuhar and for how long. &quot;Tomorrow, you 
            are to explain why you are here. To the police I think,&quot; said 
            the English Teacher, &quot;and if they ask your religion, you say, 
            'Orthodox'.&quot; &quot;But I've already told some people that I'm 
            Jewish.&quot; &quot;No matter, just say Orthodox.&quot; So, as we've 
            spent the whole day wondering what will happen, nervous about bad 
            things or bad words, especially directed toward Kesi Admasi, time 
            goes by very slowly. Coffee is served, locally brewed alcohol from 
            Dagusa grain, plain Injera for everyone but us, and no hearing. We're 
            led back to the coffee shop and more waiting. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We're finally joined by the English Teacher 
            who we had figured would be translating the hearing and we could ask 
            her what was going on. She tells us not to worry and that the one 
            who is supposed to meet with us is &quot;not present.&quot; With a 
            touch of the flu, I finally communicate, I think, that I want to go 
            lay down. We are led across the street, saying goodbye to the English 
            Teacher and led into a house we haven't been in before. Someone is 
            preparing food for us. Ugh! Annie and Barbara eat something, we all 
            drink tea and leave. Passing the coffee shop to head home, to lay 
            down (I hope) Kesi Admasi notices that the &quot;official&quot; is 
            present and we go back inside. It's about 3:30 in the afternoon. Some 
            children are sent to get the English Teacher and they return empty 
            handed. The official gets up, always carrying his rifle, and leaves 
            to go look for her. There are two or three men in Debebuhar we've 
            seen carrying rifles. Why, we can't imagine. Ethiopian people, from 
            our experience, are very friendly, peaceful and serene. The cows and 
            goats seem to be the same.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">In a few minutes, we're finally all assembled: 
            Kesi Admasi, the English Teacher, the two police, the three of us 
            and 20 or so others to watch including 2 other teachers. I'm glad 
            about this because their English is also good and I feel more comfortable 
            with multiple interpreters.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">&quot;O.K., do you have permission to be here?&quot; 
            translates the English Teacher. We present our passports with the 
            Visa we got at the Ethiopian Embassy in Nairobi. Unfortunately, it's 
            in English. I read it to the English Teacher who translates. &quot;Visa 
            good for a single Entry...&quot; &quot;What is the meaning of zis?&quot; 
            &quot;For entry within 30 days of Issuance...&quot; &quot;What?&quot; 
            &quot;For 30 days from the first date of entry...&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">A few minutes of explanation seems to suffice. 
            We are asked when we arrived and where we've been during our visit 
            to Ethiopia. &quot;What is the purpose of your visit?&quot; I explain 
            that I have a friend from this area in America and we are here to 
            visit with his family and see his homeland. Kesi Admasi is his uncle. 
            &quot;Does the local region know you are here?&quot; &quot;We're sorry, 
            we didn't understand that this was required. We were invited by Kesi 
            Admasi and we came.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">That was it. &quot;We are concerned about your 
            security and want you to travel safely,&quot; the officer said through 
            the English Teacher. Thanks were said and we were done, tired, relieved 
            and glad we weren't asked about religion.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Sunday, February 2nd - Debebuhar (Barbara)</b><br>
            It's morning now. Cow has been milked, water brought from the spring, 
            dirt floors swept with a tree branch. The sun slants in at an oblique 
            angle (it's early yet) and the shadow of my pen streaks across this 
            paper, clear blue sky, it will be hot soon. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Later at night &#133;<br>
            This is the place our travels in Ethiopia have been leading to. It 
            feels like a real gift from Tigabie to have been able to come here 
            and settle in with his family - part of a fantasy I have held about 
            this trip that we would be able to live this simple country life. 
            I can romanticize many parts of it - the look of the thatch-roofed 
            cooking hut, the mud walls, the humor of the cows and donkeys trying 
            to walk into the house all the time, the chickens that do. We're living 
            with Tigabie's uncle, Kesi Admasi. His face reads of laughter and 
            gentleness. His has a wisdom of spirit that reads through his whole 
            being. I hope my photos may capture that. We sit here in his house, 
            no electricity or running water, on the outskirts of this village, 
            at the edge of a small plateau that drops off into a valley on one 
            side and rises to the mountains on the other. Incredible setting. 
            Eight of us in this room with dirt walls and dirt floor and a tin 
            roof. The Admasi's are talking on in Amharic - I can't understand 
            them so it's a cheerful flutter of sound, rising and falling against 
            the constant background of crickets. No electricity - candlelight. 
            Not really enough to see by so this writing is challenged. The sound 
            of the baby lets me know she is here too - make that 9 of us - I hadn't 
            realized. The walls are lined with baked mud benches, covered with 
            cowskin. (Annie cringes at the thought.) The sound of the dog reminds 
            me he is outside for our protection, but I've never felt unsafe. High 
            on the walls, handmade baskets alternate with calendars put out by 
            the Pepsi Company (kept for their photos) and glossy reproductions 
            of the &quot;Holy Family.&quot; One set of shelves with cooking utensils. 
            The bed I am on was brought in for our comfort - everyone else sleeps 
            on the benches around the walls (except for Kesi Admasi and his wife 
            - they have their own bedroom but I've never seen it. I'm glad they 
            haven't given that over to us - they've given us so much already.) 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">In Gondar before coming here, Kesi Admasi bought 
            a box of candles, a flashlight and a new tea strainer. In Debark, 
            he bought a new blanket. Special things for our visit - simple, thoughtful 
            kindness. Big purchases for a family that has so little. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">This is country living. Cows are milked; water 
            is hauled from the spring down the hill. Grain is grown, harvested 
            and dumped in a circle of logs where the cows can walk on it to crush 
            it down and release the grain from the chaff, then it's thrown in 
            the air in baskets, the chaff blows away, the grain is collected. 
            Baskets are woven by hand, grain is ground by stone against a baked 
            mud hand mill, Injera is cooked over a fire stoked with cow dung. 
            We've seen all steps of the process. Coffee is ground by pounding 
            it with a heavy metal part that clearly was part of a car or truck 
            in some earlier incarnation. Very little is wasted here. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">This country has make us think so much more 
            than other countries - about the roots of poverty about the inequities 
            of developed &amp; developing countries, about our role as visitors/guests 
            here, as citizens of a developed country, as citizens of the world, 
            about what we have and what is really needed to be happy. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333"><b>Wednesday, February 5th - Gondar (Annie)</b><br>
            Before the trip, I wanted a visor not a hat, movie star-like sunglasses, 
            bell-bottom pants and &quot;great beauty.&quot; Now I would much rather 
            wear my gray-brown hat rather than my visor or my sunglasses. I would 
            give anything for a normal pair of pants and as for &quot;great beauty,&quot; 
            I have re-defined that greatly. Before the trip, I wanted my room 
            Japanese, now I want it foresty. Before the trip, I hated everyone 
            who had ever said wrong or done wrong to me. Now I would give anything 
            to apologize for not forgiving them. Before the trip, I thought I 
            was perfect and everyone who said otherwise was mean and stupid. Now 
            I can't help but wonder who I thought I was.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Before the trip, I thought I was &quot;normal.&quot; 
            Now I see I'm not. I like shopping for lights, not for clothes. I 
            like to clean my room, not watch TV. I like broccoli better than French 
            fries. I keep a large candy stash for the sole purpose of not knowing 
            what else to do with it. I love to paint and build and weave and spin 
            thread and make jewelry. I am a vegetarian because I love animals. 
            I can't kill bus though I am terrified of spiders. In short, I believe 
            that last year I was so set on being &quot;normal&quot; I forgot to 
            be me. I forget to have fun. I forgot who I was. I hated Trea for 
            telling me to go away (though I was probably very annoying). I couldn't 
            befriend Andrea because one time she said I was stupid (I probably 
            deserved it). I am sorry now and wish I could go back and do it over 
            but time goes on and all I can do is hope: hope I have truly changed, 
            hope it can be forgiven, hope in time all will be well again.</font></p>

    <p><b>Quick friends in Villamartin</b><br>
      While Barbara was snapping photos at the fair, she was accosted by this 
      group of men who wanted their pictures taken. She took their photo; then 
      we all stood around talking for a while &amp; by the time we were finished 
      they had invited us for a drink and demanded a photo all together. We declined 
      the drink, but got the photo. (Note, the guy in the sunglasses is either 
      an important politician or a policeman, or both - our Spanish wasn't that 
      good at this point, so we figured it was a good idea to do what he wanted!)<br>

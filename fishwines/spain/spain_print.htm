    Bullfighting, Flamenco guitar and dancing, Tapas bars and sidewalk cafes, 
    500-year-old churches, crooked streets. The icons of Sevilla, Andalusia, Southern 
    Spain are many and they're known throughout the world. They've got lots of 
    tours and shops that sell t-shirts flamenco CD's, aprons and postcards. </font></span></font></b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Inside:<br>
    It's only necessary to put a little time or distance between yourself and 
    the tours and you're inside these icons, seeing, smelling and feeling experiencing 
    the strength, speed, passion and beauty of the Andalusian people. They speak 
    a fast brand of Spanish and go late into the night. Bars and restaurants on 
    the corner, all over the city, in every neighborhood 2,3,4 on a block. Beer, 
    tinto limon (iced red wine with lemon soda), tapas, ice cream. Beer for 60 
    cents per glass. Speeding scooters, the transport of choice to navigate the 
    narrow, crooked streets. Stumbling upon groups of churchgoers outside a beautiful, 
    night-lit stone church.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Beside:<br>
    With a little more time and open eyes, it's even possible to see beside the 
    icons. The mid-day siesta, when businesses close for 2 &frac12; hours in the 
    middle of the day for family meals and a quick nap. At night, many, many people 
    - out in the streets, sidewalks and courtyards transformed. Groomed babies, 
    paraded around in frilly clothes - quiet and sedate in equally frilly strollers, 
    umbrellas to block the sun. Retired men, standing at the bar, having earned 
    the right to spend their time (and their Euros) eating their favorite meats. 
    Chunks, pieces or layers of meat. Chicken or beef, fried or with sauce. Of 
    course, ham sandwiches. Soccer games on the bar tele, family conversations, 
    teens making plans, friends catching up.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Beyond:<br>
    But beyond the icons, this is where people live, beyond the tours, beyond 
    the hype, beyond the Alcazar. In a big city, with another language, such powerful 
    icons, and only a few short weeks, this Sevilla has been hard to find. And 
    how do we know that what we observe is emblematic of Sevilla, of Andalusia, 
    of Spain? The intelligence, intensity and beauty of our 4 Spanish teachers. 
    The machismo of Lucas. Pilar's cooking. The ever-present ice cream and the 
    evening walks. And what do these things mean? What do they say about a people? 
    And how do we connect these dots with the icons of Sevilla to make the picture 
    whole?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">I don't know.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>September 17 - Sevilla - Paul<br>
    </b><br>
    Although Sevilla is a cool city by many accounts, I haven't figured out how 
    to enjoy it yet. The center of Sevilla is really old, actually built way before 
    cars, but first&#133; I got sick. I had 102 fever for 3 days and basically 
    just lay in bed and slept the whole time. I did go to a clinic here and found 
    out that I had this plug (literally) in each ear! The doc couldn't get them 
    out with his water pistol, so he gave me a prescription for eardrops to begin 
    the dissolving process. Finally yesterday I went back and got them out. It 
    was, like; bigger than a pencil eraser in each ear. I don't know, just the 
    accumulation of Guatemalan dust and wood smoke. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, we're finding it a bit difficult to find our way into the life 
    of Sevilla. It's pretty easy to be tourists). There is a substantial &quot;tourist 
    infrastructure&quot; which literally fills the narrow, centuries old streets 
    of the barrio Santa Cruz where our Spanish language school is: great scenery, 
    tapas bars, flamenco performances - all that shit. But we're trying to figure 
    out how not to be tourists (wouldn't you figure?). What is it really like 
    to live here in Sevilla? What are 12 year olds up to? As you might imagine, 
    this was easier in small pueblo Guatemala (and probably easier in any small 
    town). We enrolled in Spanish language school in the center of the old town 
    and are living with the prototypical middle-class Andalusian family. Man, 
    they talk fast and it's stretching my &quot;pre-intermediate&quot; Spanish 
    to the max. How long can I get away with nodding my head when I have no idea 
    what he just said?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Life in Sevilla&quot; for us consists of white 
    bread toast and jam with coffee for breakfast, language school in the mornings 
    after a 35-minute walk in the rain through these cobble stone streets with 
    a 5&quot; wide curb on one side, sandwiched between 4 story, 400 year old 
    buildings. Monday, our first day of school, and the first day of school for 
    Sevillan kids, was a &quot;red alert day&quot; because of how much rain fell 
    so fast. Their school was cancelled. Ours wasn't (wet all morning). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Leaving school can be pretty dangerous. There are literally 
    traffic jams of tourists, 40-80 in a group (most groups are German, but many 
    are English, French, Japanese, as well). From 1-2 pm is rush hour here as 
    businesses shut down, many stores close, and everyone heads home for the mid-day 
    meal and a nap, to begin working again at 4:30. There's like 2 days in one 
    here! This meal though and in fact, this mid-day time, is really one of the 
    highlights of the day, when we're not being humped by this loco dog the family 
    has (NO MORRO! NO!). The whole family surrounds the table and there's a big 
    meal, with meat of course. Annie's actually doing great as a &quot;Veheteriana&quot;, 
    spreading the gospel about her love of animals. <br>
    <br>
    After lunch and rest (we haven't actually napped yet, other than my three 
    day sleep-fest) we play, &quot;Guess what time it is&quot; because we can't 
    believe it's actually 5:30 when it seems like 2 pm.) </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">At about 9 pm another wondrous and amazing Andalusian 
    ritual begins when, I swear, every house in Sevilla empties out and grandparents, 
    families, groups of kids&#133;everyone walks around and/or sits in sidewalk 
    cafes eating the evening meal. The sidewalks are packed with plastic tables 
    and chairs that get sep up just before this time of day. This goes on until 
    about 11 pm at least.<br>
    <br>
    Last night, we went back to school, however, to learn to dance two of the 
    four &quot;Sevillanas:&quot; Barbara, Annie and I - the only guy - with four 
    German students in our Spanish Language school and our &quot;grammatica&quot;/dance 
    teacher MariaJose (&quot;Mariaho&quot;). I felt as stupid in dance class as 
    I do in language class. I hate when they add stuff on before you figured out 
    the first stuff they try to teach you, and then more stuff.... (I actually 
    threw in the towel, and sat and watched rather than continue to humiliate 
    myself).<br>
    <br>
    At this point, we're leaning heavily (&quot;please you guys!&quot;) toward 
    pulling the rip chord this weekend, spending a week in one of the &quot;pueblos 
    blancos&quot; south of here, and a few days on the Mediterranean beach before 
    heading for Lyon France, etc., etc.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Wednesday, September 25 - El Bosque, Annie<br>
    Growing Up</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Sevilla was not so inspiring. We stayed in a hotel 
    and ate out a lot. It's really hard to get food. It seems that all people 
    eat here has strong cheese or meat in it. I end up eating potatoes with eggs 
    a lot. That's why we are now eating at home a lot. In Spain, ice cream is 
    a big thing. They give you this huge cone (about 1 foot long) and one scoop 
    of ice cream on top. I think the big part for them is the cone but I much 
    prefer ice cream to cone on a hot day or any day in fact. We have not found 
    any ice cream stores in El Bosque. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Friday we went on a trip to another town. They let 
    me sleep in 15 minutes. When they were rushing to make sandwiches I felt bad 
    I couldn't help because I was still getting ready. I told them I'd wash clothes 
    tomorrow but I don't know how, so it might be even more work for them. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Here, there lives a cat; I call him Trepadoro (&quot;Climber&quot; 
    masculine). He looks a lot like Climber (I miss her 9). He has the same colorings 
    but his fur is not nearly as long or luxurious and the toes on his left hand 
    foot are curled under so he has sort of a limp. I think it was a car. I visit 
    Trepadoro a lot. His is very affectionate and he has a sister. She is scared 
    of me and runs away when I come near. Sometimes with them is a cat that looks 
    just like &quot;Velvet&quot;, Morgan's cat but I never get very close. She 
    is scared too.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">As I go on this trip, I feel like I regret a lot of 
    what I did in 6th grade. I feel more confident in what I do and more happy 
    with myself. I am growing up and I like it.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Friday, September 27 - El Bosque - Paul<br>
    Town Square</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">We've been in El Bosque nearly a week now and it has 
    been much more enjoyable for me than Sevilla. I guess I was just built for 
    small towns. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Getting off the bus, we hiked up into the center of 
    town past a gauntlet of local &quot;El Bosqueians&quot;, probably a hundred 
    and fifty of them. We ended up in the plaza of City hall looking down on the 
    entrance to the church along with everyone who wasn&acute;t by the church 
    doors or lining the street. Taking our cues from the local &quot;gente&quot; 
    we waited and watched. Ten minutes later, the bride came walking down the 
    hill in the middle of the street, arm in arm with her father and entered the 
    church to the smiles and whispers of the town folk.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">We've made many friends here already. Our house is 
    a block from a great little &quot;Town Square.&quot; A few doors in the other 
    direction, the houses end. Soon after, the road turns to dirt and up into 
    the hills above town. There's a nice little pine forest there with the cemetery 
    nearby. Pedro, a 60+ year old who lives a few doors down, has befriended us 
    mightily. Our first day here, he invited us in and pulled out a photo album. 
    After flipping through a few pages of gravestones, I realized that he was 
    not showing us memories of dead relatives but that he carved marble for a 
    living. We saw much of his work in the cemetery the other day and today, he 
    showed us two works in progress in his shop. He's also got a whole bunch of 
    birds in cages and when he shook a container of cat food by his back door, 
    five street cats came running in to eat. Pedro and his wife own a casita in 
    Chipiona, a small fishing village/beach town near Cadiz on the Atlantic coast 
    of Spain. He's been trying to talk us into going there for a few days now. 
    Finally, today, we relented. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Part of me assumed he was trying to &quot;sell us&quot; 
    on his place so he could make a few bucks but I also thought that this feeling 
    of mine is the result of my American conditioning (you can't trust anyone). 
    &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I said to Annie and Barbara, &quot;when an opportunity 
    like that presented itself, we should go for it even though it may backfire.&quot; 
    So there it is, Pedro will drive us an hour to Chipiona on Sunday where we 
    hope to swim in the Atlantic for a few days before heading to Barcelona and 
    on to Lyon.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">It's been great to partake of small town Andalusia. 
    Each morning, the bread truck comes up our street and honks. Folks come out 
    and buy fresh bread for the day. We've also met a number of people in the 
    town square. Barbara asked a women if she new about the fruit of prickly pear 
    cactus which she had found on our hike that day. Just then a guy drove up 
    in his pick-up truck. The square is so intimate and the street so narrow that 
    often people drive by slowly enough to participate in what's happening in 
    the square. A few minutes later, the guy came walking up with six peeled, 
    ripe prickly pear fruits for us. We all ate them together and have been friends 
    since, exchanging &quot;hola's&quot; and other conversation (language permitting). 
    We've also spent a bunch of time with a gaggle of neighborhood kids, Pedro's 
    mom (Teresa, 83) and the daughter with whom she lives. We've been invited 
    into a number of houses, shared beer, local sweet wine, bread, cheese, salami, 
    little fried fish and the ubiquitous hard crackers served with tapas at every 
    restaurant we've been in in Spain.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Yesterday, I had the big idea that Barbara, Annie and 
    I spend the entire day in the square recording the comings and goings of people, 
    collecting data that we could graph and compare to public spaces that we visit 
    in other places (also great &quot;homework&quot; for Annie). Barbara and Annie 
    agreed and there we sat, taking turns counting for 15 hours. It turned out 
    to be pretty tedious most of the time but as the days go by, I think the experience 
    will sink in more deeply. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">There's a bar on the square that provides the biggest 
    reason for people to visit the square. This turned out to be primarily a guys' 
    place. I got to the square at five after 7 am and the bar was already smoke 
    filled and had several working guys preparing for work by drinking coffee, 
    orange juice and/or whiskey. Kids also use the square after school and late 
    into the evening, drinking from and playing with the fountain. One kid fell 
    in yesterday, which was remarkable given how many kids walk along the edge 
    reaching precariously for the water coming out of four spouts, one on each 
    side of the fountain. Boy did he get yelled at.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">I also noticed that several guys visited the square 
    (i.e. the bar) several times during the day. There were the village crazies, 
    like the guy who drives around this small town all day long in a little blue 
    car. This other guy hung with us for several hours. This is his weeklong vacation. 
    He knows how to count to four in English and does so each time he wants to 
    use a number in a sentence. Looking up, &quot;one, two, free, four, size&#133;&quot; 
    There's also this man who's lost a leg. He lives across the street from the 
    plaza - his wife wheels him over several times during the day and leaves him 
    there for a few hours at a time. Once I helped lift his wheelchair up the 
    few steps into the bar. I also met Francisco in the plaza who, one day went 
    into the electric office and asked that his electricity be shut off. For several 
    years, he's been a vegetarian - extremely contrary to Spanish culture - has 
    no car, no TV, and no electricity. He loves nature and does astrological readings 
    for people. He hurt his back somehow and collects insurance so doesn't need 
    to work. Things began to slow down by about 9:45 so we decided to give up 
    at 10:00 pm and figure that the rest of the visits were just people walking 
    through the square to visit the bar.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Today, we mostly avoided the square, spending our time 
    mapping out the next leg of our trip and visiting with Pedro, but the few 
    times we walked through or past the square I felt a great fondness. Having 
    experienced the place during all parts of the day yesterday; having struggled 
    with the tedium of counting, counting, counting; having watched the people 
    of this town use this communal treasure with it's lemon trees, it's solid 
    benches and it's calming fountain; my belief in public spaces was greatly 
    reinforced. This centrally located, solid, well-defined, beautiful place does 
    a great service as the backdrop for the unfolding life of this community: 
    a community that has used the square for at least several hundred years and 
    from yesterday's count, I'm guessing (and hoping) it will last at least a 
    few hundred more.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Sunday, September 29 - Chipiona - Annie<br>
    A Big Day</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Today, we went to the beach. I don't really like it. 
    I didn't really want to go. My mom did. Last night, I went out with three 
    12 year old girls and one 10 year old. Paul told them to talk really slowly 
    for me, they kept yelling at each other, &quot;Mas despacio!&quot; (more slowly). 
    I found I understood maybe 70-80% of what they said but answering was hard 
    because though I understood the words, I didn't know them (like if someone 
    asked me if I liked pencils with colors on them, I wouldn't have been able 
    to say &quot;only the kind that are sparkly&quot;. But if someone said, &quot;I 
    like sparkly pencils.&quot; I could have understood it). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">They seemed really nice and I would have liked to get 
    to know them better, but we went to the beach. I left them my e-mail address 
    and my home address and I hope they talk. That just shows you the difference 
    between Seattle and El Bosque, I can't walk into town at night with only friends. 
    In El Bosque, the people know each other. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">After, we went to the discoteca, only for a while (they 
    saw me rubbing my ears and asked me if they hurt. I said, &quot;a little,&quot; 
    so we left). There weren't enough chairs so two of them ran (snuck) into a 
    man's house and came out with chairs (every time he came back, we would all 
    sneak behind the bushes). A really big food in Spain is sunflower seeds. They 
    offered me some and I said I didn't really like them. They looked at me as 
    if they had never seen a person who didn't like sunflower seeds.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Today, we were supposed to get up at 7 am. Either the 
    alarm didn't go off or we didn't hear it. Paul woke up at 8:20 and woke us 
    all up.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">I didn't get my shower but we made it on time. When 
    we got here, we went for a swim, explored the town (it not very nice but we 
    never did find the real center). I took a shower, we explored some more, ate 
    dinner and came home. It was a big day.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Sunday, Sept 29 - Chipiona - Barbara<br>
    Watching Annie Go Out</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Last night Annie went out with some girls in El Bosque 
    - four or five of them, from 10 til midnight - girls on their own in this 
    small town - late for us, but not late by Spanish time. Annie, so excited 
    before leaving, dancing from room to room, picking out the best blouse, the 
    best pants - excited and nervous too, because this is Spain, after all, and 
    late, and no one speaks English. At first she said, &quot;Will you come with?&quot; 
    and we all knew it wouldn't work, but we said &quot;sure, maybe for a while, 
    we'll see when the girls come by.&quot; And of course when they came, all 
    of them talking and laughing in the street, she just left on her own, a quick 
    goodbye. That was it and my daughter was out with the girls til midnight. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Ten o'clock now and what were Paul and I to do until 
    midnight? We walked through town, down below to the touristy area (what there 
    is of it; a few bars, fake waterwheel, internet caf&eacute;, some strings 
    of light and a tired disco). Paul headed to the internet caf&eacute; &amp; 
    I walked on a while. Coming back to join up with Paul, I saw a group of girls 
    on one side of the street, calling out to some boys on the other side - four 
    or five girls or so, one with her hair pulled back &amp; wearing a special 
    blouse, special pants, out on her own for the first time - a beautiful young 
    woman. I hesitated in the dark, moved past, unseen. Met up with Paul - some 
    time to kill, there's no computer available. We stroll around ending up at 
    the disco (loud music and a foosball table). Down the stairs, Paul in front, 
    he turns into the disco &amp; backs out quickly. &quot;Annie's there.&quot; 
    &quot;Did she see you?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Good.&quot; We turn around, 
    go back and wait for a computer, making sure to be home before midnight. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Monday morning 9/30 - Chipiona - Paul - <br>
    Carl's Hat</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">I don't wear hats. I never got used to it. Yesterday's 
    strong Spanish sun almost burned my forehead and today, I should wear a hat. 
    Before we left Seattle, I know I would be in this place - needing a hat. I 
    was there in Guatemala too.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Before we left Seattle, I looked at the half-dozen 
    odd hats that had accumulated in the closet and none felt right. Mickey Mouse, 
    Seattle Mariners, Solar Energy Association&#133; none had any meaning to me 
    or looked good. Stevie's US Marines hat, I don't think so.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Then, there are the fisherman/tourist hats - the canvas 
    ones with the wavy brim all around and the little metal vent holes. Or the 
    new micro-fiber version that lets you snap up one side to show that you're 
    really an outback, world traveler, not a tourist. No way. I couldn't do it. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In a quandary, I waited until the last minute, still 
    indecisive. At the last Friday morning get-together of a group of men with 
    whom I've been sharing every Friday morning for the past eight years, Carl 
    got up to leave. He began to walk away. Looking down, I saw his plain gray, 
    baseball-style cap with a lighter gray bill. It had a third shade of gray 
    - between the other two, at the base of the bill, a sweat stain from Carl's 
    exertions: on his bike, in his garden. For a moment, I contemplated letting 
    him walk away and stealthfully picking up his hat, not sure I could explain 
    what I wanted. Not sure he would understand. &quot;Carl, can I take this hat 
    with me?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; I had explained it, and he understood.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In Guatemala, we stayed in a poor, mountain town in 
    the highlands where most of the Mayan people grow corn, weave their own clothes 
    and cook over wood fires in their adobe homes. They sold, even in the little 
    corner tienda, stylish baseball caps - stiff and new - brims formed in a perfect 
    half-circle curve. They had Nike symbols, the logo of the Brazilian National 
    Soccer team, etc. I was tempted to buy one - to be &quot;in&quot; with the 
    mostly younger men who wore them. But many others wore traditional, fine, 
    pressed, coated straw hats with a colorful band of woven Mayan fabric - some 
    clearly new, others, perhaps generations old. Carl's hat fit into this category 
    for me and I was comfortable wearing it.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">We've been in Spain for 3 weeks now and I've worn Carl's 
    hat only once: in Sevilla. For a few-day stretch, it rained each morning as 
    we walked the half-hour into the Barrio Santa Cruz for Spanish language class. 
    One day Carl's hat did the trick. The other two, it poured and even the hood 
    of my raincoat didn't keep my head dry. The Spain that we have visited, though, 
    has been one of narrow streets that press pedestrians, cars, motor scooters 
    and the rest of community life into the space between 2-4 story buildings 
    and into plazas with fountains, orange and lemon trees, and 500 year-old churches. 
    In this Spain, the intense light of the sun most often doesn't reach the street 
    and when it does, it's a celebration with the with whitewashed walls, the 
    flowing fountains, and the incredible hand carved stone details of the church 
    fa&ccedil;ade in various states of disrepair. Hats aren't really needed here 
    and rarely seen. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">But there is another Spain, just outside these dense 
    whitewashed towns: without shade, without walls. Here, the Spanish sun is 
    relentless and makes this a great wine-growing, farming, and horse-rearing 
    region.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In Villamartin, a small, whitewashed hill town at the 
    base of the Sierra, we spent 2 hours at a festival that was an amazing display 
    of the relationship between people and horses. It was mostly men, it seemed, 
    who had trained their horses to dance to the syncopated rhythms of Andalusian 
    music, following their riders' subtle commands as they kicked, side-stepped, 
    bowed. The riders, of course, wore hats: Elegant flat-topped, broad-brimmed 
    hats that matched their elegant clothes. Do they wear these hats all the time, 
    I wonder, or are they just for show?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Men often wear hats for show as well as for work, or 
    to hide the expression in their eyes. Especially, I'm guessing, in cultures 
    where men are taught not to feel, or not - at least - to show their feelings.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">One day, in the square in El Bosque, another small 
    white pueblo of 2000 people, with surrounding farmland very close-in, we encountered 
    a man who worked in the field. He wore a hat. It was a lot like Carl's - beat 
    up and sweaty. It might have been gray too, but I can't really remember.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">In the summer, he harvests the ripe fruit of prickly 
    pear cactus and sells it outside the village market near the square. He brought 
    us six from his last harvest of the year. They were sweet and juicy. I remember 
    liking him instantly. Was it his generosity with us, who he had just met, 
    giving us his last fruit? Or was it his hat?</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">The many purposes of a man's hat: I'll be thinking 
    about all of this, I'm sure, as I put on Carl's hat today and head into the 
    Chipiona sun.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000"><b>Monday, September 30, 2002 - Barbara<br>
    Trying to get my hands around Spain</b></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Spain has been harder to capture in a photograph or 
    a few words, harder to know. Perhaps because we started in a much bigger city, 
    perhaps because we have moved around more here, perhaps because in many ways 
    it already felt vaguely familiar (cars &amp; fashions &amp; food &amp; technologies) 
    &amp; vaguely foreign at the same time. So I have come away disappointed with 
    my photos and writing. Bits and pieces that don't add up to the whole of Sevilla 
    or El Bosque, not the way the picture of Marcella, or of Flori in her kitchen, 
    or Todos Santos on market day captured Guatemala for me, or the poems that 
    seemed to flow of their own accord through my pen. No, not like that. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">But in truth, I loved Sevilla with its twisting, narrow 
    streets and beautiful old buildings - the streets too narrow for cars and 
    a sidewalk both, so one gives way to the other randomly. The streets where 
    you are always on your guard for motorcycles, cars, bicycles, kids, dogs, 
    dogshit, whatever. Forcing a strange form of intimacy as you maneuver through 
    these narrow ways negotiating the right of way with the people you encounter 
    on the street. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">I love the light, playing hide and seek in the intricate 
    carvings that cover the buildings, the soft colors that change as you look 
    in different directions, the warm glow that draws your eye as you pass a doorway 
    and hints at the skylit courtyard beyond. I have a few pictures of these (ones 
    that give me joy) and memories of others I couldn't capture (the green shimmer 
    of the wall under the vine covered trellis at the Alcazar - the camera couldn't 
    capture that). </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">The shadow of what might have been, what might be follows 
    me around here. Should we have stayed longer in El Bosque so Annie could get 
    to know the girls better? What would another beach have been like? What would 
    it have been like to go to language school in Cadiz instead of Seville? It's 
    harder here for met to just take what comes. Perhaps that's just the phase 
    of the trip that I'm in. </font></p>

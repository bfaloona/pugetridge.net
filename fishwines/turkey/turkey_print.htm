            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Monday 
              7:30 am</b> - We put on our backpacks and left my folks at the Hotel 
              Desiree in Sorrento on the West Coast of Italy, grabbed sweet rolls 
              in a bag and walked to the train station. Walked right on the train 
              and ate our sweet rolls.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Monday 
              9:00 am</b> - 31 stops later arrived in Napoli, thought we were 
              in the wrong station, but no, we recognized it, bought tickets to 
              Brindisi through Taranto and were helped to the track by an unsolicited, 
              friendly old scam artist we thought was a train station official. 
              Got on the local train by mistake. It didn't feel right. Got off 
              and asked some other waiting passengers. Called the ferry company 
              to see if there was a boat to Greece leaving that night (we had 
              gotten conflicting information before). &quot;No. Yes.&quot; She 
              said. The calling card ran out. 15 minutes later, we got on the 
              train. Nice train. Table, ate yogurt, rolls with jam, cheese. Played 
              cards. Read. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Monday 
              2:00 pm</b> - got off in Taranto. Went down stairs, under the tracks 
              and up to track 3. Got on the train to Brindisi, an old one this 
              time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Monday 
              3:30 pm</b> - got to Brindisi. Walked to the waterfront, checking 
              in with travel agents and boat companies expecting to catch an 8 
              pm ferry to Patras, Greece. Finally found out the only boat schedule 
              to go for the next two days was cancelled. Inspectors on board. 
              &quot;But, there's a boat from Bari leaving at 8 pm.&quot; &quot;Should 
              we stay here for two days and wait?&quot; Barbara went to shop for 
              food; I went to see if I could figure out if it was possible to 
              get to Bari in time. Yes, we can get to the 5:25 train! It's 5:05. 
              I walked quickly ahead to buy tickets. &quot;3 to Bari.&quot; The 
              departure board said the next train to Bari is at 5:46. Back to 
              the window and asked. &quot;Oh, that's the fast train you want to 
              Rome at 5:22, that's extra money.&quot; Paid more money, got on 
              the train, it left.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Monday, 
              7:10 pm</b> - got to Bari, grabbed a taxi, no time for the confusion 
              of getting a bus to the harbor. Taxi dropped us at the ticket office. 
              Buy tickets, catch shuttle to the boat. Walked on with 20 minutes 
              to spare. Tough to sleep in the airline type seats, snuck into the 
              bunkroom for a few hours. Lots of walking, playing cards, smoky 
              lounges. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Tuesday 
              1:00 pm</b> - arrived in Patras. Having heard that Patras was not 
              a nice place to be, bought tickets on the boat to get on a special 
              bus to take us to Piraeus near Athens to get the ferry toward Samos. 
              Barbara ran across the street in search of food. We held the bus 
              and she came back with a feta pie. &quot;No food on the bus.&quot; 
              We wolfed it down and got on the bus. Welcome to Greece.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Tuesday 
              3:00 pm</b> - Got to Piraeus and found out that the boat to Samos 
              leaves only once per week and getting to Turkey is difficult this 
              time of year. One boat leaves at 4:00 pm. Better catch it. Decided 
              to get off in Syros and spend some time in Greece. Literally ran 
              to the boat across the harbor and got on. 10 minutes to spare. Ropes 
              came off, started pulling out of harbor, almost immediately backed 
              into the dock where we stood for 4 hours: 30 minutes at a time. 
              Engine running the whole time, solving some problem with the anchor. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Tuesday 
              midnight </b>- Finally left the harbor. Met a Dutch guy on the boat 
              living in Greece, spoke English and German too. He bought the beer. 
              I bought the coffee. In the bar, met a women also going to Turkey. 
              &quot;There's only one boat to Turkey a week, leaves tomorrow at 
              5 pm.&quot; Change plans again. Keep going. Expected to get off 
              at Syros at 9 pm, now it's Samos tomorrow afternoon. No sleep again.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Wednesday 
              1:00 pm </b>- arrive in Samos, Greece. Last stop. &quot;Going to 
              Turkey?&quot; says a guy we were walking toward with the half dozen 
              other folks (aside from the couple dozen Greek army troupes) leaving 
              the boat. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;You are lucky! This is the last 
              boat maybe for the next month. Leaving in 10 minutes.&quot; The 
              boat had brought a tour group to Samos from Kusadasi, Turkey and 
              was going back right now. Paid the &quot;exit tax&quot; to Greek 
              customs officials, got on the little boat with another 6 or 8 people. 
              On to Kusadasi. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Wednesday 
              3:00 pm</b> - arrive in Kusadasi, a port city with 263 hotels (last 
              year's count) and not much else. Let's stay here anyway, get some 
              sleep, some real food. Figure out what to do. Walk into the customs 
              office with some Australians. Australians: $20 tourist visa per 
              person. Americans (big smiles on the customs officials faces): $100 
              - retaliation for the cost of tourist visa's for Turkish citizens 
              into the U.S. we find out later. Only had $100 and some Euros. Was 
              taken to the money-changing kiosk across the street. $300 in traveler's 
              checks. Given 489,000,000 Turkish Lira. No time to ask about exchange 
              rate, do the math, count the money. 340,000,000 to the laughing 
              customs officials (only came out $17 in the hole on that one). An 
              Ausi couple had phoned ahead to a guesthouse in Selcuk, a smaller 
              town about 50 kms away. They've sent a van to pick the Ausi's up. 
              Change in plans and get in the van. Let's keep going.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>Wednesday 
              4:00 pm</b> - Walk into Artemis Guest House. &quot;Sit, rest, have 
              some apple tea. Then we'll show you to your room.&quot; Settle in, 
              fire place, rugs. </font></p>
          </div>
          <p><font color="#000000">Walk, train, train, walk, train, taxi, shuttle, 
            van - across Italy.<br>
            Ferry, bus, walk, ferry - through Greece.<br>
            Ferry, van - ah, we've arrived in Turkey. It's good to be here.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><br>
            <b>Monday, November 18, Konya - Here in Islam (Paul)</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Turkish hospitality is challenging! I'm not 
            used to receiving such friendliness. I have to say, I'm also a bit 
            on edge about what I'm afraid might be false hospitality - carpet 
            salesmen for example: Invite you in, serve you tea, engage you in 
            wonderful conversation&#133;all the while, you're waiting for the 
            sales pressure. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Then there's the fact that I'm a Jew in the 
            most Muslim city in Turkey. It's Ramadan (&quot;Ramazan&quot; in Turkey) 
            and there are Mosques everywhere, their minarets piercing the smoggy 
            sky. At any moment there are several mosques in view. As the bus drove 
            into Konya, there was a ton of new building going on. Clusters of 
            large apartment blocks sitting solidly on the flat, unvegetated ground 
            around a brand new mosque - dozens of these new clusters. Having grown 
            up as a secular Jew, I'm can't conceive of such a strong daily presence 
            of God.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Mevlana - we call him Rumi - was a 13th century 
            Muslim scholar, poet, thinker, and leader. He came from Konya and 
            had something to do with creating the whirling dervishes who whirl 
            in a trance to mystical flute music, dancing their relationship to 
            God and symbolizing the tenuous connection between heaven and earth. 
            We visited the Mevlana museum, which is in the 700 year old lodge 
            where the dervishes lived and whirled. There were a few other tourists 
            present on this sunny November Sunday but there were many, many Muslims 
            who came and clearly held this beautiful place and Mevlana's sarcophagus 
            in great importance. Entering, with shoes off and head covering for 
            women, it was very somber, quiet, as most of Konya has felt for our 
            short one-day visit. Because it's Ramadan, people fast from sun up 
            to sun down, so most restaurants are closed and I guess people are 
            taking it easy. The call to prayer booms from loudspeakers on the 
            minarets five times a day and people pack the mosques to pray, women 
            in areas off to the sides.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">In Selcuk as well, we noticed this separation 
            between men and women. At night in Selcuk, coffee houses were packed 
            with men - watching soccer games on TV, playing cards, smoking, talking. 
            Here in Konya, outside our hotel, several men hang out, working together 
            to find buyers for their carpet shop. In the park outside the Mevlana 
            museum, men sit on benches in animated conversation, fingering their 
            prayer beads - three groups of 33 beads on a single string. There 
            is also the Hamam (the Turkish bath). Last evening, I decided to see 
            what it was like. I made the mistake of going at 4:45 just as it was 
            getting dark. The daily Ramazan fast ends at 4:30 and restaurants 
            open for an hour or two for the day. I was the only one in the Hamam. 
            After a while, though, there were four or five other men with me, 
            a few of whom enjoyed watching the American tourist get a rough message 
            in traditional Turkish fashion. All the men were in my age group and 
            the mood was more relaxed and lighter than anything we felt outside.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">There are western-dressed younger women here 
            in Konya that can be seen on the streets but the vast majority of 
            women are dressed in baggy pants under ankle length skirts with sweaters 
            over long sleeves and a headscarf tied or wrapped at their necks. 
            Outside, and in public places at least, they don't congregate the 
            way that men do.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">So, we feel very much out of place here in 
            Konya. Like an oppressive blanket along with the smog, lies over this 
            physically drab city of 650,000 people.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">One delightful respite from the general heaviness 
            we felt in Konya was the time we spent with 23-year-old Nazif whose 
            father owns a carpet shop near the old hotel in which we're spending 
            the night. Despite the risk of an uncomfortable hard sell, Barbara, 
            Annie and I agreed to take up his offer of tea in his shop after returning 
            from the Mevlana Museum. Downstairs, surrounded by beautiful hand-woven 
            Turkish Kilims and carpets, we listened to Nazif's father sing and 
            play the Saz, an 8-stringed Turkish folk guitar. Sticking to our pledge 
            to each other and to him, that we would not buy any carpets, we joked 
            about his continued attempts to get us to buy, we learned a little 
            about Turkish culture, turned down all of his &quot;special&quot; 
            offers, and had a really nice time. Later that night, Nazif and I 
            returned to his basement and danced together to his father's music, 
            drank more tea and talked openly about our lives. He didn't once offer 
            me a carpet!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We both hoped that the US would not start a 
            war with Iraq and Nazif held out the hope that their newly elected 
            government would tackle the widespread corruption and the economic 
            struggle most Turks are up against. All I've read in the English language 
            media that we found in Europe about Turkey's new government is that 
            the party's leadership is Muslim. We've spoken about this to 5 or 
            6 people so far in our few days in Turkey and everyone is excited 
            about the new leadership. Several people have felt free to point out 
            that they did not like Bush's attitude while also being adamant that 
            Muslim people, the Koran, and traditional Muslim leaders like Mohamed 
            and Mevlana stand for peace and love and that people like Osama bin 
            Ladin cannot be &quot;true&quot; Muslims.</font></p>

            English in school. I have known her for 8 &frac12; hours. I have shown

            necklace, I have given her a money bag, We have exchanged addresses, 
            I have shown her pictures of: my house, Guatemala, We have eaten dinner 
            together, made very good friends and gone our separate ways. I hope 
            not entirely. I want to return for Ramazan festival. I love making 
            friends but hate saying good-bye.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Good-bye may seem forever, farewell is 
            like the end, but in my heart's the memory, and there you'll always

          <p><font color="#000000"><b><br>
            Wednesday, November 20, Kayseri - Turkish Hospitality (Paul)</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">3:30 pm, we met Nida (the Servas Host we are 
            staying with) and Fatih (her boyfriend) in front of the city-center 
            mosque, looked for boots for Barbara, bought flowers. Incredible feast 
            to break Ramadan fast: Nida, her mother, father, mother's sister, 
            husband, daughter, two others. Talking about families, Cohousing, 
            Turkish and American culture, our ancestors. I was a little scared 
            about saying that Barbara was raised Christian, and I as a Jew. They 
            asked about Annie, we had no answer. Their experience so different 
            - always Turkish, always Muslim. We struggled through &quot;no religion.&quot; 
            Father prayed after dinner on a prayer mat on the floor in the living 
            room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;We're leaving in 20 minutes.&quot; The 
            doorbell rings. It's the downstairs neighbors (husband and other daughter 
            of the women who came by last night - so curious about the American 
            family). So sorry to hear that we are leaving the next day. Because 
            of Ramazan, he says, he is free to take us around anywhere. He knows 
            all about Anatolia. Everyone is talking at once. Nida showing us her 
            photographs, translating for everyone else. Phone rings, we must go. 
            Fatih is downstairs with his car, waiting. He takes us away on an 
            amazing evening. With Nida and Fatih, we visit the little cabin that 
            Fatih has built, 30 minutes drive away. Turkish rugs and cushions, 
            an outhouse, garden. Turkish music, Turkish coffee, fresh nuts (really 
            good). Showing pictures of Cohousing, our trip; finish looking at 
            Nida's photos of Turkey. Wonderful friends! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">At 11:00, we contemplate sleeping over. Yes! 
            Comfortable, informal, compared to Nida's parents nice apartment home 
            in the city of Kayseri. But, not so practical. We're leaving tomorrow. 
            &quot;You must come back for the Ramadan festival!&quot; In the car, 
            helping us map out the next day's trip. Hugging good buy. Such good 
            friends in just two days! None of us can believe it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Come in at 11:30, everyone still here waiting 
            for us. More talk. They want to see our photos. I suggest Annie and 
            Fatma might be bored with all this, go in back bedroom. Their faces 
            light up and they go. Fatma is learning English so they can communicate. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Nida's mom gives Barbara a beautiful hand made 
            crocheted doily. I'm touched by the sharing and say so.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">At 12:30, we're all tired, the other's leave. 
            Fatih called. &quot;He feels different, like a good friend is leaving.&quot; 
            I start to cry, then Nida, Annie, Barbara and Nida's mom. How crazy 
            is this? &quot;You cry for good things, not bad,&quot; her mom says 
            through Nida's translation.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">This is so far away physically and culturally. 
            But Nida is our bridge and we're all middle class. I notice Annie 
            is wearing Fatma's necklace.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We all stand in the foyer outside the kitchen. 
            Barbara, Annie and I, Nida and her parents, thanking each other and 
            talking about this family connection that has just happened. &quot;y 
            gejeler,&quot; we all say, &quot;good night.&quot; &quot;You must

            Saturday, November 23, Guzelyurt - Ramazan Feast (Paul)</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We've been in this small town in Central Anatolia 
            for five days now and plan on three more weeks. This place continues 
            to amaze and baffle us. We take hikes into an amazing landscape of 
            rock cliffs with mosque/church ruins carved into them; walk past several 
            hundred year-old houses made of huge carved stones - some of which 
            are world class ruins, others still occupied. Interspersed with these 
            beautiful stone walls, we see cows and sheep, stray dogs and cats, 
            lots of smiling children, poor Turkish farmers as well as middle-class 
            Turks who find a variety ways of making money in their difficult economy. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">This beauty, the indescribable friendliness 
            of the people, and the presence of Islam constitute the three constants 
            of our experience in Turkey so far - each one deeper than we can conceive. 
            Although we have not yet found a rhythm to ours days here, we have 
            spent a great deal of time with a small group of people we have met 
            here in Guzelyurt.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We landed here Thursday night, tired and apprehensive. 
            It was near dark when we asked the bus driver if he know where the 
            2 family pensions were that were listed in the guidebook pages we'd 
            copied before leaving Seattle.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Turns out that the bus driver owned another 
            pension (not to mention the bus and one of the stores in the center 
            of town - we found out later on a walk after dinner. He came out of 
            his shop waving us in for tea as he saw us walk by).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We haven't found any English speakers so on 
            Friday we headed to the school we noticed in the new part of town. 
            The kids showed us to an office where we were welcomed by 3 men, our 
            hands sprinkled with a traditional Turkish mixture of lemon juice 
            and alcohol, and a kid was sent to get &quot;The English Teacher.&quot; 
            Although not fluent, the English Teacher knew several words. We tried 
            to explain our desire to help out at school or in some other way and 
            to find a local family to live with to experience Turkish culture. 
            We made a date to meet on Sunday after a special program for teachers. 
            He really wants to help but he's only been teaching in Guzelyurt for 
            a year and lives in Aksaray, a grimy industrial town of 100,000 people 
            thirty km away.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">He went off to class and we went on, wondering 
            how we might wiggle our way out of the nice but isolated 3rd floor 
            pension of this rather new house and into Turkish village life. After 
            a little more walking, Annie begged out and Barbara agreed to go back, 
            hang out and read with Annie while I went to the other school in the 
            older part of town. It was early afternoon and lots of kids were out 
            playing - elementary school kids, well-dressed as almost all Turkish 
            people are: skirts, ties, sport coats. It was fun exchanging a few 
            English words with some of the bolder kids and playing a little soccer. 
            Then, I found out that the building behind was the high school, said 
            &quot;Thanks&quot; and walked down the path and into the front door. 
            &quot;Teacher?&quot; I said to a few students and was led into an 
            office with 3 more men in their 30s standing and talking. Very little 
            English. 2 teachers and the principal. They too, really wanted to 
            help, but as hard as we tried: words, pantomime, sketches, we couldn't 
            communicate much. In the end, I was pretty sure I had been invited 
            (&quot;with wife and children&quot;) to meet the principal, Mehmet 
            back at school at 4:15 to go with him to his family's dinner.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Sure enough. After an awkward wait, while they 
            figured out the best way to shuttle everyone over, we ended up in 
            a beautiful old Greek house in the old part of Guzelyurt. I'm still 
            not sure how everyone was related but there were at least three families 
            with 4 generations. A total of 12 adults, 4 kids and us. Because of 
            the shuttle, we were late getting there since the Ramadan fast ends 
            right when the imam's prayer booms out from the loudspeaker on the 
            Mosque. This has been true everywhere we've been in Turkey (In Kayseri, 
            the prayer from the main mosque in the city-center was broadcast on 
            TV). So, the food came in a furry to the round table at which we sat 
            on the floor - the men and we guests, women serving and eating at 
            a separate table: Incredible amounts of great food and so quickly 
            brought and eaten that I was sure we needed to get somewhere - the 
            mosque I assumed - for worship after dinner. Soup, olives, salad, 
            lamb in sauce on rice, a cheese-filled pastry, stuffed grape leaves, 
            yogurt to dip these in and yogurt to drink.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We sat on the floor around the table with the 
            tablecloth draped over our laps, dishes coming and going and filling 
            the table. There was very little talking as we all wolfed down huge 
            quantities of food. Finally, desert - figs and pastries, slowing down, 
            more salad, one more piece of cheese pastry (probably my favorite), 
            sigh.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">And then we sat - for 6 hours! Playing with 
            the kids, all doing origami (thanks for starting that Annie!), discussing 
            our lives as best we could - passing the Turkish-English dictionary. 
            Once again marveling at Turkish hospitality and the incredible strength 
            of Islam in their lives.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Then men alternately prayed together and went 
            out on the patio for a cigarette. We drank tea, made music, paper 
            airplanes. Everyone shared everything (except the serving - which 
            of course was done by the women - never an empty tea cup), the drumming 
            on the tea tables, the holding of the children, the conversation. 
            At one point, we were all in a circle on the floor huddled around 
            my sketch trying to explain how religion differed in community life 
            between Turkey and America, how it could be that we don't pray every 
            day.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We never know what would happen next or how 
            long this would all go on. At 10:30, the father began making a raw 
            ground lamb/bulgur/spice dish that we ate wrapped in lettuce, again 
            in huge quantities on the floor, table cloth draped over our laps. 
            More yogurt drink, coke, more tea, more music.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Come to school Sunday at 10:30. Special 
            teacher festival.&quot; Mehmet said as we left.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;How are we ever going to repay the world 
            for what we're being given on this trip?&quot; I asked to Barbara 
            and Annie, as we get ready for bed. None of has an answer for that 
            yet.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b><br>
            Monday, 24 November, Guzelyurt - letter to family and friends (Barbara)</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">It's been a long time since I've written any 
            emails and since it's cold and rainy (snow) here in Turkey, I'm thinking 
            of everyone back home (and elsewhere) and longing for your warm company. 
            I'm writing this off line so I can spend some time with it. I hate 
            the rushed feeling I have in an internet caf&eacute; and I wonder 
            if you all can sense it when I write you from there. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Our trip the past 2 weeks has been so full 
            and fast; I am just now catching my breath (unfortunately in a place 
            with no internet access, so I don't know when this will actually reach 
            you). Our time in Europe was filled with family and friends. So good 
            to be with the Burkes in southern France, Misty and her mom in northern 
            France and Ed and Sharla in Italy - a different rhythm to the trip 
            - more like vacation - sights to see, friends to share them with &amp; 
            not much struggling with different languages. We laughed a lot &amp; 
            I realize it's that deep, silly laughter that is so hard to reach 
            when we're traveling alone. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">But now we're on our own again, delving into 
            new people, new customs. It's harder, but I can see I also grow more 
            when we jump into the middle of a culture and struggle to understand/be 
            understood. After we left Italy, we did a marathon boat and bus trip 
            through Greece (barely touched ground) because we learned on one of 
            the ferries that the &quot;last boat&quot; to Turkey was leaving the 
            next day. I was a little disappointed, as I wanted Paul and Annie 
            to experience Greece. I have very fond memories of Greece from 30 
            years ago - very friendly, happy people, dancing and drinking and 
            enjoying beautiful landscapes. But there you have it, we sailed right 
            through the Greek isles without even setting foot to land. The boat 
            did seem to be one of the last of the &quot;season&quot; as a few 
            days after we arrived in Turkey, we met a woman who was trying to 
            &quot;get out&quot; and couldn't -without flying. Through this trip 
            we have been blessed with travel connections that miraculously work 
            in our favor. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Turkey has been an incredible experience. I 
            am overwhelmed by people's kindness and hospitality. Travelers often 
            speak of &quot;Turkish hospitality&quot;, but your first experience 
            of it is through the carpet salesmen who pull you into their shops 
            to talk about Turkish customs, serve you tea and sell you a carpet. 
            The thin veil of their hospitality is so uncomfortable for me and 
            since we are buying no carpets, we spend many awkward moments trying 
            to avoid these encounters in the tourist areas. But once we left the 
            tourist areas, that ended and we fell into the true meaning of the 
            phrase. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">After spending a few days near the Roman ruins 
            at Ephesus, our first major stop in the center of Turkey was at Kayseri 
            to stay a few days with Nida, a Servas host. She's such an incredible 
            young woman, it is hard to describe. She and her family opened their 
            home and their friendship to us. Every night we were up until after 
            11 talking, eating or showing slides. They fed us, introduced us to 
            their friends and neighbors, took us to the university architecture 
            department and out to Nida's boyfriend's summerhouse. They also spent 
            a whole day driving us around Cappadocia viewing crazy rock formations 
            with houses and churches carved into them (check website). The landscape 
            here is dry and a surprise to me. It looks barren as you drive by 
            in a car, but its beauty comes out as you walk among its stones and 
            fields. We were searching for a place to spend the next 3 weeks in 
            Turkey and I had fantasized spending them in one of these rock houses. 
            But though these Cappadocia houses were fascinating, the level of 
            tourism in the villages was too much for us. We changed our plans 
            at the last minute and headed for Guzelyurt, a small village on the 
            edge of Cappadocia that was supposed to be less touristy. And here 
            we are now. It is much less touristy. Only a few pensions to stay 
            in - no hotels. Here the hospitality continues. We have been to the 
            school and met the teachers and principal and some students. We have 
            been invited into many people's homes, for dinner or just a tea. I 
            was so touched yesterday when we met some kids and their mother came 
            out to invite us in to their house. They had 5 kids and were fairly 
            poor and spoke no English. But still they gave us walnuts and apples; 
            we laughed at the two smallest kids and I cried at their kindness. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The kindness here is both heart warming and 
            overwhelming. I feel I have little to give in return - it is hard 
            for me to just accept and appreciate. So hard to be always receiving 
            and not knowing how to give in return. (There is a lesson there somewhere!) 
            I also often find myself needing time to pull in, to be alone in my 
            thoughts. Paul seems to be able to be &quot;out there&quot; all the 
            time, but I am learning to give myself time to regroup. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We have talked politics with many people from 
            many different countries. People universally think that Bush is stupid, 
            &amp; recognize the difference between US people and their government. 
            Many people here respected Clinton and I am surprised at how astute 
            people are about American politicians. I don't think its coincidence 
            that the attack on the World Trade Center happened during Bush's presidency 
            rather than Clinton's. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We are also frequently asked about our religion, 
            especially in this country that is 98% Muslim. Religion is so integrated 
            with everyday life here. I see the strength of this cohesive lifestyle 
            and shared values, shared worldview. With so little shared language, 
            it's hard to describe what our &quot;religion&quot; is, so I become 
            a Protestant and Paul becomes a Jew. And Annie? &#133; Well she becomes 
            a combination. It is strange to think of myself again as a Protestant, 
            and I think about how my early church-going days shaped who I am. 
            As for who I am now, well it is too hard to describe in this Muslim 
            world and so few shared words. The other night I was about to say 
            that I feel closest to Buddhism, but just as it was about to come 
            out of my mouth, one of the men said that Buddhists were crazy. It 
            is hard in this culture to appreciate someone who does not believe 
            in one central god. Christians and Jews are Ok, but how could I now 
            try to describe what Buddhism means to me, with my 5 words of Turkish 
            and their 100 words of English? So I let pass and am still a Christian 
            to them. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">This dry landscape makes me think about Seattle 
            and its lushness - of scenery and friendships. I see something here 
            or there and think of one of you, wish I could share it with you. 
            After visiting the university, I also started having dreams about 
            teaching again. I have a very good life, I can see. From this distance, 
            I wonder how I ever got overwhelmed with the little things that consumed 
            my time in Seattle. There is so much beauty in my life there; I hope 
            these insights return to Seattle with me.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Thursday, Thanksgiving night, November 28 
            - Guzelyurt (Paul)<br>
            Turkish Barbershop</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Since the moment we set foot in Turkey, I've 
            noticed how clean cut and well dressed Turkish men are. I've seen 
            men standing with their cows at the watering trough in a sport coat 
            and tie. This was not out of the ordinary. I didn't read about this 
            in any guidebooks. Then I went to a Turkish barbershop.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">First the shave: Lather, hot water off the 
            wood stove, making cream with the brush and cup, over and over my 
            face, after towels are put on, carefully wiping off my lips with his 
            finger, working the warm lather into my skin. A new blade in the straight 
            razor and then: take to my face (Turkish Muslim, blade to the throat 
            of an American Jew. I wonder what was going through his mind?). Pinching 
            my skin to pull it tight in each area to be shaved. Working carefully, 
            like a watchmaker.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Repeat the whole process again and wash my 
            face. Burning cotton slapping, slapping, to singe the hairs off of 
            my ears. Now, I'm ready for a haircut and the more experienced barber 
            takes over, washing my hair and cleaning my ears out with cotton. 
            First, comb and scissors, then the smaller comb and scissors. Now 
            the electric trimmer and small comb. A new blade in the straight razor 
            to shave around my ears, my side burns and the back of my neck. Now, 
            holding the straight razor against the comb, combing my hair back: 
            The precision of a dentist.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Wash my hair again. Blow dry. With lemon cologne, 
            massage my head, my face, my shoulders, arms and hands. Ending with 
            skin cream and face massage. Two hours in the chair, in the care of 
            two Turkish men. Towels, razors, shave ream, lemon cologne, face cream, 
            and deodorant, all for 3 million Turkish Lira ($1.80).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Four times during the process, the same guy 
            walks in, &quot;Salaam Alekum.&quot; &quot;Alekum Salaam,&quot; reply 
            the men in the shop, the barbers, men in chairs, others waiting and 
            others just hanging out. Annie came with, doing her needlepoint. The 
            only female I've ever seen even set foot in a Turkish barbershop. 
            &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; asks one of the boys and they giggle. 
            Young men, old men, apprentice barbers, starting at about 10 years 
            old, graduating, in order, through: washing towels, making lather, 
            washing hair, cutting kid's hair, shaving, to being full-fledged barbers 
            by about age 15.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Beats therapy for walking out looking, feeling 
            and smelling good. Some time with friends, learning a trade, time 
            for contemplation. I highly recommend it if you're ever in Turkey.</font></p>

            Memories</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">How long has it been? Forever and ever. Or 
            maybe a few days. I don't know. It seems so long ago we left. And 
            yet, I remember so little of what we have done and so much of what 
            we did before. I remember even what I forgot I remembered. Having 
            grandpa paint my hair black in front of the 1st grade classes to be 
            Pocahontas in the Sanislo school parade, making up toys and explaining 
            how they worked and why they would sell, I wanted to make a rocking 
            horse named rainbow with a heart button on it that you would push 
            to make it play music (I would make it our of wood. Instead, I drew 
            a picture), How proud I was when we were learning cursive and Mr. 
            Purcell came over and aid, &quot;So, that's where your good handwriting 
            went.&quot; How upset I was when Mr. Purcell gave me a yellow card 
            because me, Sophia, and Angela couldn't find our way back from recess. 
            How jealous I would get at Macaila because Ms Nicholas would always 
            give her stamps. I loved the way those stamps smelled! How Angela 
            and I made pretend cameras out of duplos or something and would pretend 
            they were special cameras that would write what people were saying 
            on the picture. We would go around taking pictures and giving duplo 
            to people saying, &quot;here's your picture.&quot; How made I got 
            when Miss Parkhurst wouldn't let me cut out the picture of a bear 
            that I colored in. She said, &quot;I don't what you to ruin that nice 
            picture you colored.&quot; I went home that day and told my parents, 
            &quot;If she cut it out then it will be ruined.&quot; I wanted to 
            do it all myself. I was so frustrated at my grand parents because 
            I had to do an assignment about my ancestors and when I asked them 
            what people in Russia wore, all they would say was, &quot;I don't 
            know, a brown skirt or something.&quot; How Ms Schultz sat me next 
            to 4 boys and no girls. I was upset, but she said, &quot;I can trust 
            you to behave.&quot; How I would eat orange peels just to make the 
            boys think I was an alien. If they asked me I would say, &quot;Maybe.&quot; 
            I thought it was so fun. How we would write circle stories, passing 
            the paper around, each writing a part. How Mr. Purcell said, &quot;If 
            you are good, I will tell you my favorite word.&quot; It was &quot;cucumber.&quot; 
            How Mr. Purcell read us &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.&quot; 
            And made or bought us Turkish Delight. I ate some of the real stuff 
            and thought of him. How we read &quot;Ramona&quot; and I thought is 
            was so funny when she said a &quot;dawnsearly&quot; must have been 
            some kind of lamp. How proud I was when we were learning fractions 
            that I had cut out my brownies and had only one scrap. When Ms Heller 
            said, &quot;throw away your scraps.&quot; I said, &quot;or your scrap!&quot; 
            When Ms. Heller read us the story about a girl who didn't understand 
            fractions but one night she dreamed she was in a room with no windows 
            or doors and math problems on the walls. She broke the chalk in two: 
            two halves make a &quot;hole&quot;, put the hole in the wall and stepped 
            out. From then on, it all made sense. How Angela and I made up a routine 
            on the monkey bars. All I remember is &quot;Tick, tock goes the clock, 
            riding a bicycle, swimming in a lake, falling through a hole.&quot; 
            We were so proud we could sit on the bars and not hold on while we 
            moved our legs like riding a bicycle. How I invented a ponytail bun 
            and wore it for picture day. The picture person told me to look at 
            the camera and I was so mad. You couldn't see my hair at all. How 
            I read Encyclopedia Brown and his friend wore overalls and a yellow 
            shirt. From then on that's what I liked.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I have done so much and just moved on and forgotten. 
            When it all comes back, it is almost too (I don't know) too much.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Wednesday, December 4 - Guzelyurt (Paul)<br>
            The end of Ramazan</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Today is the last day of the holy month of 
            Ramazan. We had planned to go back to Kayseri to join Nida and her 
            family tomorrow for their Ramazan festival. We've been hearing about 
            the &quot;Ramazan Festival&quot; everywhere we've been since we've 
            been in Turkey. I'm so glad we unknowingly close to be here at this 
            time of year. There are very few other tourists making sightseeing 
            more enjoyable and making it easier, I think to be included in people's 
            lives. What we didn't realize though, is that all of the Turkish people 
            get where they need to go (i.e. with their families) by tonight to 
            observe the end of Ramazan tomorrow and no busses run at all. So, 
            we will go to Kayseri on Friday instead. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I'm glad to be here in Guzelyurt though, since 
            we've spent most of our time here and have participated in Ramazan 
            in many ways here. Not seeing the festival here at least tomorrow, 
            would have felt incomplete.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Today, when I began to put together some of 
            the pieces of what's been going on here, I felt very inspired. I noticed 
            that the dirt path/road that our house is on has been broom-swept 
            in front of nearly every house. Radiya has spent much of the last 
            two days cleaning the house and tonight, we went with, as the family 
            visited Radiya's father's grave. While we were there, other families 
            came and went. The trip was short: Radiya read prayers, her mother 
            weeded the gravesite and Murat answered his cell phone a few times. 
            All of the girls and women wore headscarves, including those who don't 
            normally.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">A few nights ago, as the end of Ramazan approached, 
            Islamic people spent the whole night praying. This devotion: the month 
            of daily fasting, ended by a special dinner at sun down each day, 
            breakfast at 3 am before sunrise, the families gathering, cleaning 
            house, sweeping the street&#133; has got me thinking about ritual 
            in my life. Having dropped most aspects of organized religion from 
            our lives, we're left with a hodge podge of rituals that play a mostly 
            social importance - bringing family and friends together. I see that 
            aspect of Ramazan too but there's clearly a set of deeper spiritual 
            aspects to this holy month.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Two nights ago, we were invited to Kemal's 
            house for dinner and spent another wonderful evening with Kemal's 
            and three other families: having dinner, playing with the kids, drinking 
            tea, watching the men pray, and communicating as well as we could 
            with the dictionary. At one point, Kazim motioned for me to come with 
            on a drive. Not knowing what we were up to, I grabbed some money (23 
            million TL - about $14) and got into the car with Kazim and Mehmet, 
            figuring we were off on some &quot;guy adventure.&quot; I was a little 
            nervous. Mehmet, the high school principal (I'm guessing he's about 
            30) grabbed some money too and some empty plastic bottles before we 
            left. Kazim turned on the radio and sped off out of Guzelyurt. Mehmet 
            lit up a cigarette in the back seat. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">After a few minutes, we turned right onto a 
            small paved road and a road sign said we were headed 45 and 85 km 
            in the direction of two other places whose names I didn't recognize.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Nerede?&quot; (Where) I asked. Mehmet, 
            in English, replied, &quot;We go to Alanyurt. People are very hungry.&quot; 
            &quot;Allah,&quot; said Kazim, pointing up. An important part of Ramazan 
            is making an unsolicited donation to someone you don't know: without 
            fanfare, without recognition. We drove about 20 minutes to this small, 
            dark, stone village to find the people Kazim was looking for. He got 
            their names from the &quot;Muhtar&quot; of Alanyurt (the dictionary 
            translated Muhtar to &quot;head man&quot;). An elder in each village 
            takes on this role - a city may have many - entrusted with knowing 
            who is where as well as their well being. The Muhtar had given Kazim 
            the names of some people who needed help.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">After a few stops in Alanyurt, we found our 
            way to a small, one room stone house, took off our shoes and walked 
            in. In the warm presence of 4 very old women sitting on mats and Turkish 
            rugs on the floor, Kazim talked for a few minutes, handed a wad of 
            bills to the women, hands were kissed, goodbyes, and we drove back, 
            stopping so Mehmet could buy some fresh milk from a local farmer (the 
            empty plastic bottles).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I know that charity is a part of Judeo-Christian 
            tradition also and I'm certainly in no position to judge any religion 
            against another, but being in the midst of these deeply religious, 
            accepting and giving families, I can't help feeling a lack of clarity 
            and continuity in my spiritual life. I want to gather up all of the 
            traditions I have in my family and community, somehow get rid of my 
            cynicism, and sew these together into a big enough whole to cover 
            my life with deeper meaning and to tie me with others both before 
            and after me.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Because there was a big group of family and 
            friends here to share dinner on the last night of Ramazan, we brought 
            our makeshift Menorah into the kitchen and lit the Chanukah candles, 
            and sang the blessings in the presence of this big gathering of Turkish 
            friends, doing our best, on the road, to carry on the tradition my 
            mom has kept going in our family. The night was very much like our 
            family: great dinner, hanging out, kids playing cards and braiding 
            Annie's hair. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Tomorrow, we all have breakfast together and 
            we will finally see what the Ramazan Festival looks like here in Guzelyurt. 
            I've had a mental image o dancing in the streets but tonight Radiya 
            said, &quot;tomorrow, we wake up at 5 am for Namas (praying).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Somehow, this doesn't seem like the dancing 
            in the streets kind of place,&quot; Annie said as we got into bed 
            tonight.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Monday, December 9 - Bus from Kayseri to 
            Guzelyurt (Paul)<br>
            Friends</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Riding through the dramatic rock landscape 
            of Cappadocia, a sprinkling of snow on the ground, things feel oddly 
            normal to me.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Annie, excited about the snow, hoping there's 
            more of it in Guzelyurt, and antsy being cooped up on a bus when there's 
            any snow at all on the ground, is cutting out paper snowflakes. All 
            girls and women in Turkey do lots of crafts and have showered us with 
            gifts of embroidery, crochet, knitting and have been so pleased when 
            Annie and Barbara have sewed and embroidered along side them.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Life has had a very slow pace for us here as 
            we've shared the end of Ramazan, first with friends in Guzelyurt and 
            this past weekend with Nida and Fatih and their families in Kayseri: 
            Tons of eating great food and especially large amounts of sugar - 
            Baklava, candy, chocolate&#133; at every house we visited - which 
            on Thursday, the first day of the Biyram Festival (end of Ramazan) 
            was at least six.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Before, during, and after eating, we sit, visit.&#133; 
            People talk. Often there are TV's in the background. There is some 
            joking but generally, there's a formality (subdued behavior, nice 
            clothes - even more so than usual) ritual hugs and hand kisses, which 
            is not my style. I've noticed my heartbeat slow way down and I guess 
            that if you tried to get my blood pressure, you'd need a pretty sensitive 
            instrument.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I'd love to find a good basketball game and 
            get all sweaty and winded. I don't think I've even sweated at all 
            in Turkey yet except perhaps when the wood stove was cranked and I 
            felt it inappropriate to take off my long sleeves.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Saturday, we got to spend the afternoon (with 
            Nida and her brother Yunus, Fatih, his sister Nihan and dad) at Fatih's 
            family cabin just on the edge of Kayseri. Apparently, it's pretty 
            common for people to have a 2nd home when they live in the city.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The place (land and cabin) is very sweet and 
            for the first time in Turkey we did some work - chopping wood, a little 
            weeding in the garden, tidying the cabin&#133; Many breaks for eating 
            or tea, called out by &quot;Tamam&quot; which in this case means &quot;O.K. 
            enough work.&quot; Barbequed shish kebap, bread, potatoes, nuts, chestnuts 
            off the woodstove, Turkish Coffee&#133; Barbara, Annie and I spent 
            the night here and were joined by Fatih and his parents and sister 
            again the next day for more garden work and more food - especially 
            a lamb and vege stew cooked in a clay pot over a small fire in the 
            garden while we did a few hours of work. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">After nearly a month here, the initial novelties: 
            the women in headscarves, the call to prayers, the flowing hospitality, 
            the stone houses, the language, the separation of men and women, the 
            ever-present mosques - have melted into the patchwork quilt that is 
            Turkey and we've fit nicely into the strength of family that we share 
            with Turkish people. This has been our experience. With Radiya and 
            her family, there are stronger differences, I think, between us, but 
            people see us as a family and they understand that well here, despite 
            that we are only three. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">It's no exaggeration to say that we've also 
            become good friends with Nida and Fatih. Our shared values of friendship; 
            our shared love of nature, music, photography and humor; our mutual 
            openness, and the fact that we're urban people, have helped us transcend 
            any language and cultural differences.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">After spending a few days of Biyram with our 
            friends in Kayseri, we're heading back to Guzelyurt for another week. 
            I'm a little worried about being bored (there will, no doubt, be some 
            of that) or that perhaps we're not consciously engaged &quot;enough&quot; 
            in active learning. But I've noticed that learning about a place, 
            about people, or life, really just sort of happens: slowly, incrementally. 
            Almost after the &quot;active&quot; part. I also guess the week will 
            go by too fast. We'll go to school again, perhaps trying to teach 
            some English, we'll spend more time with Kemal, Mehmet and Kazim and 
            their families, with Radiya's family, we'll meet more people, drink 
            tea, eat lots of great Turkish food and, who knows, we might even 
            get to do a little work.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000">White, I can't stand it! Snow all over the 
            ground and here I am stuck in this stupid bus, watching it. It's driving 
            me crazy. At every stop, I want to jump out and go play in it but 
            No. I have to stay here and watch it go by. A whole nother hour. What 
            if it melts? What if it ends? What if Guzelyurt is not white! Then 
            what! There is a kid of helpless restlessness I feel, like a child 
            in school or with housework on a sunny day. It's so close but there 
            is nothing I can do! I made snowflakes but that only made it worse. 
            Wabbaudd, it's melting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Phew, it's back&#133;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Wednesday, December 11 - Guzelyurt (Barbara)<br>
            A description of Guzelyurt</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">It feels like we've been in this village long 
            enough to describe it, hopefully with enough warmth and emotion to 
            hold it fast in my memory. I am frustrated with my photos here - so 
            unable to capture the spirit of this place. And of course that's because 
            it's the people who bring it to life and I've been reluctant to run 
            around snapping photos of people in the simple routines of their day 
            - it feels so invasive. So our pictures have missed much of the beauty. 
            And other photos are lost, not to shyness, but to a camera not ready 
            or a fleeting look no film could capture - so many memories not caught 
            in photos. So here's an attempt at them in words. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I have come to love Guzelyurt - it's good that 
            we landed here and spent some time. Perhaps I might have felt that 
            way about any small town we visited in Turkey, but I will never know. 
            What I know is that Guzelyurt has been good - so good that even I 
            have not questioned spending our three weeks here. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The village is perched on the side of a small 
            dry hill that looks across a valley at Hasan Mountain (a massive snow 
            covered volcanic peak that dominates the natural landscape as the 
            minarets dominate the human one). Guzelyurt is small (about 3800 people) 
            and old, a picturesque jumble of rocks. When we first arrived, I couldn't 
            read the city - handful of small market stores around a sleepy main 
            square, ramshackle stone houses tumbling away from the square, all 
            buildings low and unimposing except the gleaming metallic dome of 
            the mosque and its two minarets piercing the sky beside it. I was 
            not excited - a little uncomfortable in this dry, brown landscape. 
            My eyes darted around trying to make the pieces of it fit together 
            into a whole, not accepting how that only happens over time as familiarity 
            weaves its web and we discern the fine strands of attachment. Now 
            over the short time of a few weeks, the strands are forming as I learn 
            what lies behind the rock walls and know the friendly greetings of 
            the townspeople. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I now know that most of the houses that we 
            first noticed are the &quot;old Greek houses&quot; - built at the 
            times the Greeks inhabited this piece of land. The Greeks were here 
            until 1924 when there was an &quot;exchange&quot; of peoples between 
            Turkey and Greece and all of the Guzelyurt Greeks returned to their 
            homeland, replaced by Turks from Greece. This was the end of the Ottoman 
            Empire. Many of these Greek houses are several hundred years old and 
            hide behind walled entry courtyards that form a solid edge along the 
            street as the wall of one courtyard abuts the wall of the next. I 
            also know not to judge the hidden house by its crumbling street wall, 
            or even by the house fa&ccedil;ade that greets me as I enter the courtyard. 
            These old houses don't paint their faces for the street. But inside, 
            they open to beautiful 12' wide arched spaces, often colorfully lined 
            with Turkish carpets. Their arches rise from 2'thick solid stone block 
            walls (sandstone, I think) and peak at 14' in the center. Rock and 
            dirt piled above these massive stone arches form a flat sod roof (sometimes 
            overlaid with concrete). The concept is simple - thick, heavy mass 
            modulates the temperatures making it cooler in summer and warmer in 
            winter in this dry, sunny place that probably has a climate close 
            to that of many parts of Arizona. Most rooftops also sprout a passive 
            solar water heater (Which, along with TV's and cell phones, are Guzelyurt's 
            nod to high technology.). </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We've made our Guzelyurt home with Radiya and 
            her family (brother and mother) in one of these old Greek houses. 
            Inside, the warm reds and yellows of the Turkish carpets make the 
            rooms look cozy, though temperatures are still chilly. During the 
            winter, families here heat only one room - a combination living/eating/ 
            sleeping room. This one room (&quot;warm bedroom&quot;, Radiya says) 
            gathers everyone in the house to its welcoming warmth. The other rooms 
            are left cold and not used (except for the three of us who get an 
            extra bedroom heated at night). In my imagination, I see all the rooms 
            full of sunshine and life in summer - a time when families spread 
            out and fill the whole house. But for now, this one-room coziness 
            suits us as the snow piles up outside. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The most curious dwellings here, though, are 
            those of the early Christians, who because of persecution or monastic 
            seclusion chose to carve homes and churches out of the conical rock 
            formations and rock cliffs abundant in this area. These early Christian 
            dwellings and churches date back to the 4th century AD when the Romans 
            of this area didn't accept the concept of one god that early Christians 
            were proposing - back before Constantine embraced Christianity and 
            opened the empire to its tenets. These early idealists carved multistory 
            homes and passageways in these cliffs creating an intricate &quot;underground 
            city.&quot; There are thousands of these rock houses here - most of 
            them abandoned, but some of them still inhabited by people or animals. 
            Gaping doorways riddle the rock cliffs around the village, promising 
            adventures. I'm fascinated, drawn to them, wondering what each one 
            holds. Will we find a well preserved series of rooms with passageways 
            to upper floors, or maybe even a church complete with carved columns 
            and frescos, or just a weather-worn hole in the wall with a flat floor 
            and straw from when someone bedded sheep down there? I have trouble 
            resisting their pull, but Paul and Annie drag me away, &quot;No, no 
            not another one!&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">So, then, into this jumble of cliffs, rock 
            hewn houses and massive stone buildings, throw a couple blocks of 
            2-story &quot;modern&quot; buildings housing a handful of businesses 
            and maybe 10 small markets. A series of two lane roads connect it 
            all - some paved smooth with concrete, some rough hand-laid stone 
            (still in process). But none are traveled much except by foot or cart, 
            for there are not many cars here and local minibuses are the major 
            means of motor transit. Toss in also a main square with a mosque on 
            one side and a hotel on the other (old monastery) and you have most 
            of Guzelyurt. The shops are small, living room sized holes in the 
            wall of the street. They house multipurpose collections of bread, 
            pop, cookies, Turkish delight, dried fruit, nuts, toiletries, canned 
            veggies, paper goods, and candles. Go to a store more than once and 
            the proprietor will count you a friend.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">For what holds this village together is the 
            life that happens within it - the people and animals that shuttle 
            back and forth through its streets weaving its intricate fabric. An 
            old man leads his donkey and two cows up the main street to the public 
            drinking trough. People dressed for work avoid the sidewalk; polka 
            dotted with cow pies and donkey droppings. Chickens dart across the 
            road or peck at seeds in the droppings. Cats slink out of sight as 
            we pass. Kids - hundreds of them when school lets out - stroll in 
            their blue school uniforms, arms linked, giggling and shouting &quot;Hello, 
            what is your name? Can I help you?&quot; A group of women loading 
            potatoes on a truck pull me in through a hole in the rock wall to 
            see the piles of potatoes behind them, just off the main street. Men 
            draw together in the square or huddle around stoves in the markets 
            talking and drinking tea. Women gather beside the road in 3's and 
            4's with work in their hands - cracking walnuts, knitting a baby sweater, 
            crocheting intricate edges for the scarves that always cover their 
            heads - hands always busy. They look up, greet us, and invite us in 
            for tea. For tea is the common welcome here - that and a smile - and 
            strangers are always welcome. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Right now there are 3 strangers in this village, 
            Paul, Annie and me. Today we take a walk through the town, stop by 
            the &quot;tourist office&quot;, at the entrance to Monastery Valley. 
            Small office - a 10x10' room, a stove, a desk and a friendly face 
            - staffed all year, though tourists are rare after September. We enter 
            the office. A smile of recognition, &quot;Bus yesterday, me driver&quot; 
            (everyone here as several jobs). Chairs are pulled up to the fire. 
            Life is slow, there's time to sit together, time to stumble through 
            our broken Turkish, his broken English, time to share a cup of tea. 
            The call to prayer washes across the village, echoes off the mountains, 
            fills the valley, holds this moment. Guzelyurt. Turkey.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Thursday, December 12 - Guzelyurt (Paul)<br>
            Feeling empty</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I have nothing to write. I could come up with 
            some colorful paragraphs about walking in the cold outside Guzelyurt 
            to look at the town covered in snow with Hasan Mountain in the background. 
            Yes, it was beautiful but I couldn't get into it. I noticed the quiet, 
            lack of traffic noise, the sound of sheep bells coming from somewhere 
            in the distance, the cold air freezing my nostrils and stinging my 
            ears, the pretty scene of the creek: frozen in spots, trickling in 
            others, heading down into the steep ravine that parallels the hill 
            that holds Guzelyurt. But my noticing felt sterile, unemotional. I 
            thought about God and how to connect, surrounded by natural beauty, 
            the mosque in the foreground, in this village that's been inhabited 
            by deeply religious people for the past 1400 years, but I came up 
            dry.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Or our recent times laughing and playing Crazy 
            Eights (or &quot;Chilgin Sekees&quot;) with Murat and Radiya or other 
            mealtimes and teatimes, but it feels like we're at the point where 
            we've seen the sites, we've experienced a great depth of family life 
            and now, there's more of the same. I find myself wanting to create 
            a &quot;life&quot; beyond being a traveler: Not living out of the 
            backpack, finding a routine of things to fill my days, a simple way 
            to be useful here, choosing relationships to pursue and deepen&#133;But 
            there isn't time for that - three more days here and we're off to 
            Ankara and Istanbul.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Saturday, December 14 - Guzelyurt (Paul)<br>
            Jewish boy prays in mosque</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Woke up this morning depressed. We're about 
            to cut the string again and float out into the world untethered. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Days here have been a bit aimless: teaching 
            English or observing classes a little, taking walks, exploring, or 
            just sitting in &quot;warm bedroom&quot; (like now) writing, playing 
            cards or just sitting. But every evening has been alive with visiting, 
            family dinners, tea, games, religious and political conversation, 
            showing pictures of Cohousing, asking questions about what life is 
            like&#133;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">In Guatemala, we were sad to leave also: the 
            family we stayed with, our Spanish teachers, Annie's weaving friend. 
            We had wonderful friendships that became of our time with people - 
            relaxed and informal. Turkey has been different. Here, our relationships 
            are at the same time, more formal and deeper. The newness of Islam 
            for us and the rules of contact (for example, some Islamic women will 
            not shake hands with a man who is not related, others will kiss each 
            cheek - and you can't tell by appearance) make things a bit awkward 
            at first. But we are a family, and Turkish people are all about family, 
            so it doesn't take long for closeness to develop. One warm room that 
            serves as the family's living, sleeping and eating room really supports 
            this closeness.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The other night, tea at the geography teacher's 
            house, I misunderstood what I was being told about one of the 7 or 
            8 guys there. I thought he worked in City government with Kazim, another 
            man I met here and who's been described as &quot;an important person.&quot; 
            I asked if I could come visit him at work to get a glimpse into local 
            government. &quot;Tomorrow?&quot; &quot;5:30?&quot; he said. &quot;No,&quot; 
            I said, &quot;at work.&quot; &quot;He is janitor.&quot; Mehmet said, 
            flipping through the dictionary. Oh. We made plans for tea the next 
            night. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Annie wasn't feeling well so she and Barbara 
            opted out. His family also lived in the &quot;civil servant housing&quot; 
            - $60 per month they pay, same for the janitor and the high school 
            principal. They had no furniture, just cushions on the floor for sitting, 
            sleeping&#133; 4 kids (2,4,9,11), his wife, Kemal, Mehmet, Kazim and 
            his two boys (Akif 9, Memet 9, who developed a crush on Annie) - so 
            the 13 of us sat around talking, playing with the kids, drinking tea 
            for hours: the VIP, the principle, the janitor, all together. Mehmet 
            asked if I thought they were poor and we discussed the spectrum of 
            rich and poor in Turkey vs. the U.S. I drew a graph of how I thought 
            it was (the U.S. spectrum having a much wider gap between rich and 
            poor, Turkish poor being poorer - although Barbara speculated later 
            that U.S. poor were perhaps poorer).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Then I brought up the idea of rich and poor 
            in terms of &quot;family strength&quot; and drew a graph of how I 
            thought this might look, the US being poorer than Turkey. &quot;What's 
            more important, money or family strength?&quot; We wondered how family 
            strength would be effected if Turkey was admitted into the European 
            Union (a decision pending as EU leaders were meeting in Copenhagen. 
            We later found out the Turkey was denied membership for now) and as 
            television and corporate marketing influences work their way more 
            deeply into Turkish culture. They said that &quot;Islam&quot; is why 
            Turkish families and Turkish culture is so strong and we have gotten 
            small glimpses into how strong Islam is here in Guzelyurt.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">This morning, I met Kazim, his 9 y.o. son Akif 
            and Duran in the center of town and we drove to show me the new mosque. 
            They said it was built because the main mosque was not big enough 
            to hold everyone who goes to the mosque in Guzelyurt (population 3800). 
            The Mosque is one big domed prayer space with a rug covered floor 
            and high windows that let in shafts of light. I took a few pictures.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">We went back to the main mosque in the center 
            of town. There were 15 or so men sitting on the rug facing the Imam 
            who sang a passage from the Koran. Kazim said he was going to stay 
            and pray. We'd go have tea and he'd meet us. Duran and I left the 
            prayer space into the outer room where people take off and leave their 
            shoes. I asked if it was o.k. for me to sit and pray as well. He said, 
            &quot;yes, o.k.&quot; He left and I went back in and joined Kazim 
            and Akif sitting at the back of the prayer space.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I don't have a practice of prayer in my life 
            but I felt comfortable sitting in a patch of sunlight on the floor 
            with the beautiful sound of the Imam's singing. I wondered how much 
            stronger God's presence is in a building built for that purpose and 
            when people gather to pray. As we sat, about 50 men gathered and I 
            sat quietly while they followed their prayer ritual alternating between 
            praying together and separately - kneeling, bowing. This all ended 
            in less than 20 minutes.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I thought about my own anemic spiritual practice 
            and how individual it is, having given up organized religion immediately 
            after my bar mitzvah at 13. I did not participate in the Muslim prayer 
            ritual but I did connect with the beauty and depth of God today in 
            the presence of the Muslim prayer ritual and felt a part of this community 
            that we've been living in for the past month. Many times in my life, 
            I've felt pressured by Christian people who have made no secret of 
            their desire for me to convert, but here, I've felt no pressure. In 
            fact, I've felt honored, accepted and embraced by my Muslim friends 
            here who know that I'm Jewish. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">I just realized how amazing and powerful it 
            is to have been invited into every aspect of so many people's lives 
            here. We've eaten with them, seen them at work, with their children 
            and as they pray. Radiya and her family, Mehmet, Kemal, Kazim and 
            their families and other complete strangers we've met once and didn't 
            even exchange names. I keep wondering how we can be so lucky, how 
            much love is available and freely given, and how at the same time, 
            there are places where people don't get along, where Muslim, Jewish 
            and Christian people don't trust each other and where, despite material 
            wealth and comfort people actually close themselves off from this 
            love.</font></p>

            Wedding Guest</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Yesterday, the last day in Guzelyurt. Paul 
            was going to the high school to see Kemal &amp; Mehmet for the last 
            time. Annie went with him, but I didn't feel like it, thought it would 
            be better for him to be with those guys alone, felt too much like 
            I'd be tagging along. So I headed off on my own. Started up through 
            town (my usual to see what's happening) &amp; then couldn't decide 
            which way to go. Had brought a bag of oranges in case I ended up near 
            Pushla's house, but chickened out of going there. AJ had the boots 
            &amp; Monastery Valley had too much snow, so I just kept walking on 
            the main road. When I got to the turnoff for Akyamac, decided to walk 
            there &amp; check out the village (only 2 km further). Aimless, really, 
            a bit frustrated with myself for not having a plan. But knew I could 
            probably get some exercise at least and maybe a cup of tea. Started 
            up the long series of switchbacks to the village. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Eventually I saw the first few houses, a man 
            &amp; his son with their 3 cows at the public fountain. Talked with 
            them and walked on. And then one of those magical Turkey things happened. 
            I saw them, 4 young women walking together arm in arm, laughing. I 
            smiled and said &quot;hi&quot; in Turkish. They stopped to talk - 
            all in Turkish, very excited. I had no idea what they were saying. 
            I didn't have the dictionary, only caught a few words. &quot;yes, 
            I am a tourist,&quot; &quot;America&quot; They wanted me to come with 
            them - where, I couldn't tell. One young woman made the motions of 
            dancing, so I followed them, or rather they linked me in their arms 
            and we all hurried down the hill to a small house. They pushed me 
            in first - a small entry hall filled with shoes. I took mine off &amp; 
            greeted an older woman. I guessed it was her house, so I instinctively 
            gave her the bag of oranges - silly maybe in retrospect, but it was 
            what I had brought, so I gave it. The door to the adjacent room opened 
            wider &amp; I could see it was filled with women, much talking &amp; 
            laughing &amp; I was swept into it. A small room, filled with maybe 
            25 women and children. I was plopped down in front of the stove (this 
            is a kind gift of warmth, a part of their hospitality). It was only 
            then that I noticed the young woman in the center - dressed in white, 
            a princess - with all the other women crowded around her, fixing her 
            hair, her veil, her necklace of coins, touches here, pins there, a 
            stray hair captured, a crinoline straightened. So young it took a 
            while to sink in that this was her wedding. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">And meanwhile, all the women around me working 
            to warm me up - hot water kettle between my legs, a blanket over that, 
            take off my wet socks to dry on the stove - already I am hot, but 
            can't convince them. I am roasting, can't take off my hat because 
            they're all in scarves &amp; I haven't brought one. And still they 
            rub my hands between theirs and wrap the blanket tighter around me. 
            I am laughing to myself, trying not to sweat, smiling and snuggling 
            into this chatter of women. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Do I have a camera, they ask. Yes, yes I would 
            love to take a photo of the bride. And then everyone wants her picture 
            taken. Snap, snap, snap - pulls and tugs on the camera as each photo 
            is passed around for all to see. And I worry that this is too distracting 
            on this, the bride's day. So I put the camera away. But the bride 
            comes to kiss me and I take it out again to photo her with her mother. 
            They hand her the bouquet &amp; she throws it (a familiar custom). 
            Then they take off her left shoe (I notice she has heavy woolen tights 
            under the frilly white gown) and write names on the sole of the shoe. 
            They ask my name &amp; write it, then ask if I am married. When I 
            say &quot;yes,&quot; they all laugh &amp; I realize that a woman's 
            name on the bottom of the shoe insures a quick marriage. So one of 
            the older women nods with a twinkle in her eye &amp; holds up 2 fingers 
            and they all laugh that I will now have two husbands. They ask if 
            I have children and I say one girl. They ask how old and instead of 
            answering, I pass around Annie's photo. One woman asks if she can 
            have it &amp; now Annie's photo lives with her. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The dressing &amp; hair are finished, the veil 
            in place. One woman pins money to the bodice of the bride's dress, 
            she slips on long white gloves and she is ready. We follow her out 
            of the room &amp; she enters the adjacent room with a couple of the 
            women. I catch a glimpse of a few men in there too before the door 
            is closed. But by now there are about 30 men outside the house waiting 
            in the cold. Five minutes later, the bride &amp; groom emerge, married, 
            I assume, though I am still not sure of anything. A cheer goes up 
            &amp; they are swept into a waiting car. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The crowd follows the car; I catch a glimpse 
            of a saz (Turkish mandolin) - a party will emerge somewhere I think. 
            But I am pulled in 2 directions. The original 4 young women enticing 
            me to follow the car, the older women inviting me back into the house. 
            I'm torn, but go back to the house. In the first small room, I'm again 
            surrounded by blankets and pillows. But now women are sobbing, crying, 
            wailing - and again I watch in wonder at the depth of this emotion 
            and only partial understanding as they console each other and chide 
            each other to stop. So I sit there a quiet witness. Laughter erupts, 
            crying continues, a jumble of emotions surrounds me. Calmness descends 
            and tea is served. It's time to take my leave. I left 3 hours ago 
            for a short walk of maybe an hour or so. </font> </p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Wednesday, December 18 - Train from Ankara-Istanbul 
            (Paul)<br>
            Islamic Turkey/Modern Turkey</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Today, we spent several hours at Ataturk's 
            Mausoleum and museum that powerfully tells the story of the downfall 
            of the Ottoman Empire in WWI and the birth of the Turkish Republic 
            in the few years following. Mustafa Kemal &quot;Ataturk&quot; led 
            an incredible war for Turkey's Independence against France, Italy 
            and Greece simultaneously and subsequently crafted the constitution 
            of a nation that is both secularly governed and Islamic (unlike Iran, 
            Iraq, Saudi Arabia&#133;which are still governed by the Koran). </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">The Ottoman Empire was ruled by Sultans who 
            passed the ruling power to their sons and used the Koran as the basis 
            of law. Ataturk's vision was to replace the Ottoman's arbitrary and 
            repressive system with a more democratic, representative system while 
            respecting Islam as his country's religion. As the country's first 
            leader, he instituted a number of revolutionary changes including 
            giving freedom and voting rights to women and changing the alphabet 
            from the Arabic to the Latin alphabet. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">But there are clearly some fundamental differences 
            between Islam and the modern global culture (epitomized by television, 
            its sitcoms, consumerism and liberal sexuality) that seem to be irreconcilable. 
            These influences are so much stronger in Ankara and the visual signs 
            of Islam much weaker. This dichotomy - the modern world and Islam: 
            a government that simultaneously builds mosques and sponsors Islamic 
            education on the one hand and on the other, works to participate in 
            global capitalism, is something we haven't had enough time to come 
            to understand. But I think this is at the heart of life here in Turkey 
            and internationally as well these days.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Leaving Guzelyurt and riding the bus through 
            Anatolia to Ankara, we could see dozens of small stone villages just 
            like Guzelyurt, nestled up against the hills with the minarets of 
            their mosques marking their place. I imagined them full of the people 
            we've met: strong families, practicing Muslims, bestowing their incredible 
            hospitality on each other and their visitors.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">But after a few days in Ankara, with foreign 
            embassies, government buildings, honking horns, drivers paying no 
            attention to pedestrians, fashion clothing boutiques, fast food/fast 
            paced western life style&#133; I wonder if we aren't seeing into the 
            future of Turkey's village life. Our hosts in Ankara, though less 
            devout in their practice of Islam, though fluent in English and into 
            American music, modern technology and the &quot;bachelor&quot; lifestyle 
            reminiscent of any American college campus, were no less graceful 
            and generous as hosts: ready to feed us, take us places and unwilling 
            to let us pay for anything despite their being students.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">One of the fundamental differences I've observed 
            between my culture and Turkey is that the U.S. seems to say that individual 
            achievement is most important: we should all have what we want, when 
            we want it. In Turkey, it seems the family is most important. This 
            is part of Islamic teaching and has been part of Turkish culture for 
            many generations. And family here means extended family, friends and 
            as we have seen, visitors. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">In 1920, when European countries proposed a 
            participation plan for the fallen Ottoman Empire that threatened Turkey's 
            cultural existence, the Turks fought with everything they had and 
            won. But then, they could see clearly, who was threatening them.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Today, it looks to me like the threat to Turkey's 
            cultural survival is more insidious. As more people install satellite 
            TV and adopt the fast paced urban lifestyle (we have seen that Konya, 
            Kayseri and Ankara have been and are still growing tremendously) and 
            as the government pushes for inclusion into the European and global 
            economic framework, I'm afraid that people will lose the cultural 
            importance of family and friends, spiritual practice, and traditional 
            food and music - all of the things that have defined our experience 
            of Turkey.</font></p>

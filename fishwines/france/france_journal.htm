          October, France &quot;French Countryside&quot; (Barbara)</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
          We're now in Lyon with the Burkes. Seems like so long and so familiar 
          that we have almost settled in here. Familiar, I guess because of being 
          with good friends. The familiarity is good, the ease of just doing things 
          - helping them move, cleaning their new place, cooking meals, laughter 
          over dinner. But after almost a week, we feel somewhat in the way here 
          - in their living room and trying to keep our stuff contained. </font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>11 
          October </b>&#133; So Paul and I have left Lyon, leaving Annie there 
          with Camille. We took off last night. Got a train to LaClayette (pronounced 
          &quot;LaClet&quot; not &quot;La Clay-et&quot; as the ticket salesman 
          cautioned us). Arrived a little after 7 in the evening and found a somewhat 
          tired hotel where I think we were the only guests. Walked around town 
          - dark, boarded up, empty. A few cafes and boutiques promised more life 
          in the morning. Back to the hotel early, hung out, felt like when we 
          were just dating. Fun. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Oops, 
          forgot the Chateau -quite a nice one in town, surrounded by water - 
          all privately owned. Traffic so very fast, I thought we'd be killed 
          crossing the street at night. Hands shook so much after almost getting 
          hit it was hard to take night photos of the chateau.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This 
          morning after coffee, went to the tourist office - so very helpful. 
          Pointed out the town of Chateauneuf halfway to St. Denis where we are 
          to meet the Burkes two days from now for a weekend with their friends. 
          Tourist office tried to call a B&amp;B for us, but the phone was busy. 
          We started walking the 10 km to the town, heavy mist, slight drizzle. 
          Debated taking the bus. I was leaning that way, (but didn't want to 
          admit it to P. &amp; didn't want to miss the walk). I knew he was leaning 
          the same, but somehow we kept walking till it was too late to turn back. 
          A beautiful walk it turned out to be - rolling French countryside, old 
          farm houses, cows, apple and pear trees by the road (available for picking), 
          easy talking as we walked. Arrived at the B&amp;B by 2pm. The woman 
          from the tourist office had reached the B&amp;B, so our host Madelaine 
          was expecting us. Nice old house, big bedroom, private bath. Home. Things 
          go easy when we open to them - destinations unfold, beds are available, 
          people friendly. And strange things happen. I picked up a magazine in 
          our bedroom because it had an article on Annecy &amp; I'd been thinking 
          of going there. Flipped through the pages trying to refresh my French 
          vocabulary and notice an ad for Twinrix (hepatitis vaccine). I started 
          to say, &quot;hey, Paul, do you remember what Twinrix is?&quot; and 
          halfway through the sentence remembered we were supposed to get our 
          last Twinrix vaccine here in France! There - how did that ad find me?

          Was a gentle one,<br>

          The only hotel on the main street is boarded up and has a &quot;for 
          sale&quot; sign on it.<br>
          2. They've asphalted all around the church to provide parking for a 
          new commercial development attempting to provide economic stimulus.<br>
          3. Everything is dark, shutters are closed and no one is on the street 
          at 8 pm.<br>
          4. Cars and trucks passing through town are so unused to pedestrians 
          that you can easily be run over trying to get across the street to the 
          castle.<br>
          5. The four remaining young women in town are huddled together looking 
          at their lottery tickets hoping to win their way out.<br>
          6. The only evening activity for the young men is to rev their motor 
          scooters and do fishtails down by the river.<br>
          7. There are 17 beauty parlors and 5 other specialty boutiques hoping 
          to lure the few tourists that drive through.<br>
          8. The owner of the breakfast restaurant has to run around the corner 
          to get bread when you order breakfast.<br>
          9. The only evening activity for tourists is to walk down to the steel 
          mill on the outskirts of town wondering what that incredible noise is.<br>
          10. All four locals sitting at the bar smoking their breakfast, fix 
          their stare on you as you walk in, pay, and walk out.</font></p>

          14 October - fear (Barbara)</b><br>
          We're back in Lyon heading for Strasbourg (Misty's farm).<br>
          I hold two images of French life - this vital city, which is a bit somber 
          (&quot;austere&quot;,<br>
          as the tour book termed it) but still active and urban and the French 
          countryside with its old stone farmhouses and small villages. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 
          the country/villages, community happens around the kitchen table - one 
          meal fades into the next, wine is poured, dishes cleared and then filled 
          again, talk is the thread that weaves it all together into a day. Time 
          is liquid, melts from hour to hour. You think you have just finished 
          breakfast and someone appears with afternoon liqueurs. Someplace in 
          there a walk is taken, mushrooms picked, jokes shared, problems discussed. 
          Kids appear and retreat like waves on a beach, wash over the table and 
          half the table's food washes back out with them. Somehow, the dishes 
          got washed, the food got cooked, the problems solved. Laughter and yawns 
          punctuate the night, the last plate of cheese, the last glass of wine, 
          bed.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          asked Paul to buy an English paper today without thinking how I would 
          feel reading it. Terrorist bomb in Bali kills 182 people, mostly young 
          vacationers. Young men and women at their prime - happy, dancing. I 
          have traveled these last 2 months with very little fear, meeting people, 
          receiving kindness. I have not imagined one of these terrorists beside 
          me, not grappled with trying to understand their anger and pain. Mine 
          has been a friendly world, these past months. But now I have asked Paul 
          for this fear and unknowingly he has handed it to me. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">If 
          I were in the mood for writing right now, what would I write about? 
          Would it be the cycles of dairy cows or making cheese? How twice a day 
          the ritual begins by walking up to one of the many cow pastures to bring 
          in the cows. Its fall now and the leave are colorful on the rolling 
          hills of eastern France. The air actually feels more like winter and 
          the smell reminds me of snow. Twenty cows, in two facing rows, heads 
          in the feeding trough while the mechanical milkers are attached one 
          cow at a time. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or 
          would I write about the scene around the dinner table in Bernard's old 
          mansion, with us, Misty, Martine (Misty's mom), Axel and Maxime (Bernard's 
          two boys)? I love being zany with the boys - joking around in the space 
          of the few words that I know in French and the few they know in English: 
          &quot;Hey Man, how's it going?&quot; &quot;Pwiddy Good!&quot; and &quot;AAAAAAAAh 
          fromage nah nah nah nah nah nah nah&#133;&quot; (sung to the tune of 
          &quot;I feel good&#133;. like I knew that I would&quot;). These crazy 
          dinners are like a different world from the one with the cows, just 
          outside and fifty feet away.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or 
          would I write about Claus who fascinated me. Claus is one of the originals 
          on the farm. He's been there for something like 20 years. I'd put him 
          in his early 50's. To watch him with one of the new dairy cows, squatting 
          down with his head against the side of her belly, eyes closed, calming 
          her to help her get used to this new life of milking with the gentle, 
          deep mocking sound of a cow's voice: this is a man who loves his work 
          and loves his cows. Claus also studied something like ethnology, specializing 
          in the South Pacific Islands and 7 years ago, left the farm to travel 
          for a year, visiting places like Nepal, Cambodia, the Philippines and 
          Thailand while thinking about whether to stay on the farm with it's 
          unique mix of joys and hardship.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or, 
          if I were in the mood for writing, would I turn my attention inward 
          and think more deeply about myself: How sometimes I fall in love with 
          my thoughts? I think about how others will view what I write and I ride 
          that line between the truth and exaggeration; or the complex feelings 
          I have about looking good and fitting in, in this life on the farm: 
          always working in mud and cowshit or milk processing and dish-washing?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Or 
          would I finally write about community life on the farm? The way people

          between men and women; and what I might learn from this small, unique

          Cows #1:</b><br>
          I have never known cows up close, mostly just passed them driving in 
          a car at high speed through the farmland (me driving, that is, not the 
          cows). Still, for me they're the symbol of the farming life that triggers 
          deep-rooted romantic feelings. Other than that, I know that they have 
          big brown eyes and wet noses. I arrive as a novice on this dairy farm.</font></p>

          #2:</b><br>
          They don't seem to mind being milked (if it is possible at all to read 
          their minds.) They walk in to their milking stalls without complaint 
          - of course, they get fed there. We enter through the center row between 
          symmetrical flanks of gigantic cow heads, locked in position. Huge brown 
          eyes, calm, gentle stares right down the line. 20 in all, 10 on each 
          side. We try to dump a bucket of apple mash (leavings from the cider 
          press) in front of each one as they shove their noses up into the bucket, 
          dumping the contents over their heads. Now that they're occupied with 
          eating, the milking can begin. The milking machines, stainless steel 
          and tubes, such a contrast to their soft, hairy nipples, clash of technologies 
          - god versus man. But still you have to prime the milk by hand and I'm 
          glad there's this soft contact each time. The dangers of milking: #1 
          shit - it happens &amp; when it does, you better jump out of the way, 
          #2 kicks - a lot more serious than shit, but less frequent. Seems to 
          be a design flaw here - should be a bit more distance between this sloshy 
          brown shit and creamy white milk production. Milking over, its time 
          to head out to pasture again. Here's the trick - rattle the gate before 
          you release their head locks. They always get excited to go out to pasture 
          &amp; when they get excited, they shit (yes, of course) - better to 
          have it in the stalls where it can be washed away than right outside 
          the door mixed with the ankle deep mud you take home soaked into your 
          boots and pant legs. We rattle the gate, they shit. I love knowing things 
          like this, feel like a real dairy farmer. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Cows 
          #3:</b><br>
          The first thing I realize when we approach the herd is that cows are 
          really big. I mean they start to look bigger when you think about interacting 
          with them. If they don't want to do something, it's next to impossible 
          to make them. We are eight people trying to catch one cow who's gone 
          renegade and joined another herd. (How hard could that be?) Klaus sets 
          a &quot;trap&quot; at the bottom of the pasture at the edge of the woods. 
          I can't quite understand the trap, but it seems to have something to 
          do with a bunch of logs stacked up at the bottom of the hill - understanding's 
          not my job anyhow, I'm just here to follow orders. Our strategy is to 
          circle the herd, make a racket and urge the herd forward toward the 
          trap so Klaus can lasso the cow. We all have lassos, but for most of 
          us, it's just for show. I grew up watching westerns, but have no idea 
          how to throw that perfect circle. Klaus admits that he doesn't either 
          and I start to get nervous. We begin slowly: we advance, they move down, 
          we advance more, eight of us with ropes and sticks, the cows retreat 
          toward the trap. It starts to look like this will work. She's close 
          now, the one we want, backed up against the logs of the trap. Klaus 
          wades into the herd, throws his rope, caches one horn, but she bolts 
          (Yes, cows can bolt) heads out toward the edges of our closing circle. 
          The guy she's heading toward yells. I'm just thinking how brave he is 
          when he makes a frantic jump out of her way. She's a fugitive on the 
          run again, back up the hill with Paul sprinting after her. We do this 
          dance for one more hour, chasing her up the hill this time. Now she's 
          through the fence, up the paved road and hiding in the forest (I love 
          that image of a cow hiding in the forest - brings to mind Gary Larson 
          cartoons.). We give up, drag back to the car, a bit sheepish, covered 
          with cowshit and mud to our knees. All the way home, Klaus mutters to 
          himself in German. Later Martin tells us he was very disappointed - 
          third try at catching her and she's still on the loose. She birthed 
          a dead calf seven days ago and is upset. If they don't catch her before 
          her milk dries up, she'll no longer be a milker for this year (that's 
          when we start talking hamburger). Part of me is rooting for this renegade 
          in the woods and part of me would like to see her safe in the barn at 
          the next milking cycle. </font></p>

          If cows aren't agitated, you can move them easily with a few words (Hey, 
          Oh, Vache), a little prodding. Dogs, well trained, can make them run. 
          Amazing to watch a cow run - an ergonomic incongruity, as if you've 
          just seen your grandmother do a back handspring. The dogs at Malplaquet 
          are well trained (Klaus and Martin argue over whose dog is best - Martin's 
          dog with a slight disadvantage because he was paralyzed and limps strongly 
          on his back leg). The dogs respond to voice commands to move the cows 
          right or left, fast or slow, they'll also hang back on command when 
          a mother is frightened for her calf and stands to challenge the dog. 
          Overall, the dogs do better than we do at moving the cows; I am humbled.

          #5:</b><br>
          Dairy farming's a life beside cows. You see them first thing in the 
          morning and last at night. They set the rhythm of your days - in from 
          pasture, feed, milk, out to pasture, process the milk, in from pasture, 
          feed, milk, out to pasture - two cycles a day. And the rhythm of your 
          seasons - moving from pasture to pasture, calving, milking. The scent 
          of soured milk and cowshit huddles around you like a shadow, becomes 
          familiar. I'd like to be here long enough to get to know the herd individually, 
          their personalities, their moods. Klaus talks about the renegade cow 
          like a friend, he's gentle with his understanding of her sadness at 
          the loss of her calf, he worries they won't find her in time before 
          her milk dries up, but he's not too sentimental to know they can't afford 
          to feed her until she calves again next year; he'll walk with her to 
          the slaughterhouse if the time comes. Tough love. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Looking 
          good is important to me - or, &quot;fitting in&quot;. While on the farm, 
          among a group of hippy farmers, I felt self-consciously conservative 
          looking: Clean-shaven 3 or 4 days ago compared to beards; short hair 
          compared to wild curls and dreadlocks. At Malplaquet, you wake up and 
          start working. Not that people jumped into it so fast, I'm not sure. 
          It's just that: what's the point of cleaning up, showering, putting 
          on clean clothes or combing your hair if you're just going to be covered 
          either in cow-shit, the cheese-making process, engine grease, or some 
          combination of the three?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
          3 days or so, I didn't care anymore about the clothes, pulling on the 
          same stinky clothes everyday. But looking in the mirror, I felt compelled 
          to smooth out my inch-short curls or put on Carl's hat. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Then 
          on Thursday, we went into Strasbourg with Martin to help at the market. 
          Strasbourg is a several hundred year-old city about the size of Seattle 
          an hour from the farm, near the French-German border: Cosmopolitan! 
          Strasbourg had many tourists despite the fact that it was raining and 
          the middle of October. There were beautiful old buildings, cobble-paved 
          pedestrian streets and a space-age-looking tramway. The contrast really 
          struck me as this sleek, quiet, public transit glided between the old 
          stone buildings. I couldn't take my eyes off it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          along with the well kept, dramatic streetscape were the people: cosmopolitan 
          as well. Well dressed, good looking. Oh, there were beggars and street 
          people but not many. And by and large, people wore black and gray or 
          brown.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          hadn't really thought ahead of time about how people would dress or 
          how the city itself would look. The train ride from Lyon to Strasbourg 
          and on to Schirmeck (the closest stop to the farm) had taken us through 
          a number oaf small towns set into the rolling farmland of this rural 
          countryside. The buildings had changed in style with the German/Bavarian 
          influence and seeing this for the first time from the train, I conjured 
          up no images of people except the stereotypical lederhosen and felt 
          hats.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          did know that I didn't want to wear my cow-shit jeans, thinking: &quot;that 
          might not help sell a lot of cheese.&quot; I had two other choices: 
          my dark blue pants that, in retrospect, would have made me more comfortable, 
          and my hand-made, bright red, Guatemalan pants. These, I thought, would 
          be a good choice to keep me warm and they come with good memories of 
          the hardworking, unpretentious people we met in Todos Santos. A maroon 
          fleece jacket, black fleece vest and black short sleeve t-shirt over 
          white long sleeves rounded out my ensemble. I also brought a red maroon 
          raincoat and Carl's hat for the inevitable rain.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
          a great conversation on the ride in the van with Barbara and Martin, 
          we arrived at the market outside the center of the city, set up the 
          cheese cart, parked the van, served a few customers and went for coffee. 
          After a few minutes, Martin left to tend the cheese cart while Barbara 
          and I were instantly transformed back into tourists with instructions 
          on how to get to the cathedral and an area of Strasbourg with well-preserved 
          500 year old buildings, tourist info/souvenir shops, upscale hotels 
          and trendy boutiques - &quot;Petit France&quot; it's called.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">It's 
          amazing to me how I feel in these circumstances. That, how I'm dressed 
          relative to where I'm standing, determines whether I fit in or feel 
          out of place. Why is that? Sure it's a symptom of insecurity. In my 
          mind, the &quot;right&quot; thing is to feel good about myself, &quot;who 
          I am&quot; regardless of where I am or how I'm dressed, etc. &quot;I 
          am me:&quot; similar in some ways and different in others from every 
          other human being. No better, no worse, just similar and different. 
          That's what this trip is about - exploring these similarities and differences 
          and seeing how people form community in light of these similarities 
          and differences and observing also how these are expressed in culture 
          and community.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">So, 
          I'm thinking that there are two ways that I feel comfortable - either 
          I have a place, a role, or am convinced that I'm accepted and, even 
          better, loved by those around me, or I have the proper &quot;look&quot; 
          which allows me to disappear from the view of others. Funny thing. It 
          feels like the tape inside goes: &quot;fit in and disappear until you 
          find yourself in a position to be loved and accepted by others. Then, 
          work as hard as you need to to earn that love and acceptance.&quot; 
          For me this work includes being smart, being funny, being a good boy. 
          Sometimes I think I'm handsome too which also helps me &quot;earn&quot; 
          acceptance, but as I get older, I feel this less often.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          can't help believing that most of us share this tape: that we need to 
          earn our place of love and acceptance and that doing so requires pretty 
          constant vigilance. Luckily, there are lots of consumer products available 
          to help.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Being 
          a tourist is rough in this light. I posses neither the clothes/looks 
          to fit in, knowledge of the local game, nor time to &quot;work&quot; 
          my way in. So, this makes me resistant in the first place. Small towns 
          and longer stays have helped, allowing me to meet people and &quot;get 
          to work.&quot; It doesn't actually feel like work though, as the feeling 
          of acceptance, of camaraderie and friendship - especially in a short 
          time across cultural differences - is really rewarding. I love it. In 
          Todos Santos, El Bosque, and Malplaquet: there's been a small enough 
          community and a long enough time to get to know people, share on a deeper 
          level, see our similarities and differences and accept each others' 
          friendship on a remarkably deep level.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I'm 
          proud of this, enjoy traveling this way and want to do more. But, I 
          also want to push at the edges of my insecurity. I want to feel comfortable 
          as an outsider in a place that's not my own, to wear my Todos Santos 
          pants without being self-conscious, and to accept myself without having 
          to work for acceptance.</font></p>

          still I wake up with a hollow feeling, fantasizing their return (somehow 
          I confront the thief, scare him and get the things back.) What wears 
          on me is that my camera is gone - my art, my touch on this world that 
          we travel through. And I see how much I depend on it, smile through 
          its lens. A sweet part of the trip that I grieve now it is gone. I feel 
          foolish; it is a small thing in the scale of things, but a joyful way 
          that I connect with the world and thus sad in its loss. </font></p>

          actually left on a bus from which it was stolen) and then file the paperwork 
          for its theft. We're all in Loro - a sweet small Italian hill town with 
          houses leaning on each other, climbing up the hill like pilgrims crowding 
          into a temple at the top. I'm not as settled here as in Spain and France. 
          Have not connected much with the people also, though some have been 
          kind in helping us try to find the bag and fill out paperwork. Can't 
          say I've given it much of a chance - absorbed in myself. I can see that 
          this morning I am finding myself again and this writing is just a way 
          to do it - each word a drop of water settling into a hollow until a

          the backpack on the bus. I didn't ask what the laundry would cost - 
          proud, instead about my Italian accent, thinking that I could communicate. 
          Those things getting in my way of actually being present and thinking 
          about what needs to happen. Shit!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">9 
          November 2002 - Paestum, Italy (Barbara)</font></b><font color="#0000FF"><br>
          We are now in Paestum Italy with Ed and Sharla, but I want to capture 
          here my time alone in Rome.</font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          arrived on a train with P &amp; AJ. I disembarked and they went on to 
          Sorrento to meet up with Ed and Sharla. After jumping down to the platform, 
          I felt so alone and stupid. Walking the length of the train, I wanted 
          so much to just get back on &amp; go on to Sorrento with them. I imagined 
          the look on their faces as they saw me reappear. But I plugged on ahead 
          and stopped at the first phone to call and try to find a place to stay. 
          First I tried the UW Rome office to see if someone I might know was 
          there &amp; they might just have a place for me to stay. But no luck 
          - they were all out on a field trip. So I reluctantly pulled out the 
          Servas list. The 3 Servas families I had emailed hadn't responded and 
          I felt very uncomfortable calling this late &amp; asking for a room 
          that night. I decided to try one I hadn't emailed (they only had a phone 
          number listed and I am still sheepish about using the phone for international 
          calls!) The phone rang once &amp; was picked up by a woman who didn't 
          speak much English. She turned the phone over to another woman. I was 
          trying to figure out how to politely phrase that I was a Servas traveler 
          &amp; need a place to stay that night, when she gushed out &quot;Are 
          you from Servas?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;From where?&quot; &quot;the 
          US.&quot; &quot;Do you want to stay here?&quot; That was it, I had a 
          bed for the night. Thirty minutes later, I was in the home of Angelina 
          &amp; Giovanni &amp; wrapped in the energy of Irene, their daughter. 
          Irene, it ends up, was just visiting to go to the hospital with her 
          father that night. He was scheduled for bypass surgery the next day. 
          They fed me, introduced me to a family friend, Angelo, (who gave me 
          a person to contact in Ethiopia) &amp; then proceeded to drive us all 
          to the hospital to admit Giovanni. We finished up with a quick night 
          tour of Rome. At the end of it, Angelo headed off to a theology class 
          and Irene grabbed me by the hand to catch a bus back home in time for 
          her train out that night! (Irene lives in northern Italy - &quot;Come 
          to visit there any time&quot; she says, &quot;It's nicer than here.&quot;) 
          Whew! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From 
          the lonely train platform of 4 hours earlier, the world had flipped. 
          I was enveloped in this family, sharing their wine, stories, jokes, 
          disappointments, joys and many noodles! Angelina (the angle of peace) 
          showed me photos of her peace marches, Irene's wedding, her own wedding, 
          Servas guests from the past. Angelina dotes on me and her two small 
          doge - her new babies since her kids have left home. With Giovanni and 
          Irene gone, Angelina wraps me into her life - good food, political TV 
          shows, old sentimental movies, yapping dogs &amp; everyday chores. During 
          the day, I tour Rome and the UW program, then come home each night to 
          Angelina &amp; the dogs and it does feel like a home to me, after such 
          a short time. Irene calls, Angelo calls, Giovanni calls (from the hospital 
          where his operation has been delayed) and I talk to them all on the 
          phone. I am part of their home for a brief few days and I see the true 
          intentions of Servas at, I think, its best - not a shiny polished best, 
          but a warm and human best. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          get a sense for Rome while I am there. A sense of the history that crisscrosses 
          this city and literally collides with its modern facades. The power 
          of the church, the struggles for control and grandeur. It wasn't a major 
          focus for me on this trip, but this history of western civilization 
          is creeping into my consciousness by the sheer weight of its presence. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I 
          am also glad to visit the UW program. Good to see old friends, both 
          professors and students. Re-ignited the desire I have to teach, to be 
          a part of the UW scene. I love the world of architecture and ideas, 
          pictures and drawings - such a luxury to be able to work among it. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
          lastly, in Rome, I replaced our camera. I knew in my heart that someplace 
          in Rome the Nikon 990 was sitting on a shelf, waiting for me - if I 
          could find it, if I didn't give up. So I stopped in every camera store 
          I found and on the last day, on my way back home, I poked my head into 
          another store - a little hole in the wall. No English, so I wrote down 
          &quot;Nikon 990&quot;. The shopkeeper said &quot;No&quot;, then hesitated 
          and said &quot;Usata?&quot; (used?) I said &quot;Yes, used OK!&quot; 
          He took me to the window and there it was, sitting on the shelf in perfect 
          condition. It's mine now &amp; I am grounded in my photos again! </font></p>

          don't want to forget Europe. And for some reason, now, I'm afraid that 
          I will. I was not enamored with Europe. It seemed ordinary, familiar. 
          And now as we enter Greece, our first stop with a different alphabet, 
          and head toward Turkey, it feels like I'm leaving a good friend at the 
          dock and watching my friend become smaller and smaller as the boat goes 
          off and away. I remember so much about Guatemala: the people we met, 
          the landscape, places we stayed, events we participated in. It seems 
          like we were there last week. In Europe, though, we moved around a lot 
          more and traveled differently, much of the time like regular tourists: 
          sticking together with friends and family, to English, to the guide-book 
          inspired tourists routes. So, we interacted with people whose job it 
          is to interact with tourists: hotel and restaurant staff - like that.</font></p>

              and older who rode their old-style bikes around town; the great 
              card game with Annie and Camille in the town square (having missed 
              our bus to Sienna); and the church tower with a pedestrian walkway 
              through it and a bell tower that chimed the half hour and the hour

              ash and mud 2000 years ago: streets with curbs; mixed use zoning; 
              one-way, two-way and pedestrian only streets; take-out restaurants

              farm near Paestum on the west coast of Southern Italy: amazing fresh 
              local food prepared and served gourmet style, the sweet and pompous 
              idiosyncratic ways of this middle-aged couple of Belgians; seeing 
              300 + horned, black, dairy water buffalo and the process of making 
              fresh mozzarella (good for only 3 days); walking through the 2500 
              year old Greek temple ruins of Paestum - marveling at how they could

      <p><img src="images/necklace.jpg" width="192" height="145" align="right" hspace="4">It 
        was one night, ONE NIGHT, and boom we were friends. Like a stick going 
        over a waterfall: one minute we barely knew each other, the next I was 
        willing to give just about anything to see her again. </p>
      <p>We were staying with a friend. We had met her by joining Servas: An organization 
        thought up to bring international peace by providing families for travelers 
        to stay with, all over the world, for free. <br>
        <br>
        I remember nothing of that day before she came. Almost like I was asleep 
        and just woke up when she walked in the door. I said hello and shook her 
        hand.</p>
      <p>I would like to say that we were friends straight away but we weren't. 
        I was too shy to say anything to her and I suppose she was waiting for 
        me to. In any case, though I watched her constantly, and with a great 
        amount of interest, we went on without saying a word: I stuck with my 
        family, she with hers. All through dinner, though we watched each other 
        with intent interest, no direct question was asked, no exciting secret 
        shared. It was not until after dinner that she came over.<br>
        <br>
        I was standing in the hallway. she came over and said something I didn't 
        understand. I shrugged and she laughed nervously, took my hand and led 
        me to the kitchen where Nida translated: &quot;she wants to practice English 
        with you.&quot; I held up a finger, &quot;One second,&quot; I said. </p>
      <p> When I returned, pictures in hand, she was sitting in the living room 
        waiting for me. &quot;Pictures of my house,&quot; I said holding up the 
        album. We went through it quickly: &quot;my mother, my father, my cat&#133;&quot; 
        &quot;Pictures of friends?&quot; she asked, when we were finished. I had 
        just turned on the computer when my mom called and said it was time to 
        go. We had made plans to visit Fatih's cabin. &quot;Ok.&quot; I said absentmindedly. 
        Pointing to the screen, I said, &quot;Camille, Misty, Anya, Mimi&#133;&quot; 
        &quot;Annie, its time to go!&quot; I shut down the computer, said good-bye 
        and we left. I thought that would be the end of this friendship that never 
        really happened. And I have to admit, though I was disappointed that it 
        would be left half in the making, I did not really MISS her. But some 
        things are just meant to be.</p>
      <p>We stayed out for a long time but when we came back she was still there, 
        waiting. We went on just as we had before: only watching. Then Paul 'opened 
        the door.' &quot;Why don't you two go play in the bedroom?&quot; he asked. 
        That was when our friendship really started.</p>
      <p>Some people say, &quot;It takes a village to raise a child.&quot; well 
        in some aspects that's true, but really, it takes children to raise a 
        child. Some people are just so nice and giving you want to be like them. 
        But who wants to be a boring adult. Every one needs a role model (who 
        would they ask if they didn't know what to do? Not someone they didn't 
        want to become). I just got mine. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Fatma was very brave with speaking English. She wasn't shy even when 
        I couldn't understand. She gave me everything: compliments, gifts and 
        friendship. Even through the rest of the time I knew her, I never heard 
        her utter a mean word to anyone but her friend and her sister and then 
        she was only joking. She was very active and I never heard her complain 
        to her mother even if her mother asked to her to do the dishes or something. 
        Her room was clean. Her bed was made. Every time she took something out, 
        she would put it back, but she was never mad at you for moving things. 
        Though every one has faults, she seemed as near perfect as could be.</p>
      <p>I led her to my room. &quot;It's messy,&quot; I said, blushing. She didn't 
        seem to mind. We sat down and wondered what to do. Suddenly I remembered: 
        she liked to see pictures of my friends. I took out my purple box. It 
        has: stationary that Cailey and Jessica had given me, my birthday cards, 
        a small key chain from Denis and Diane and the picture that Misty had 
        constructed from pictures of me, Camille and her. I pulled that out, &quot;my 
        friends, Misty and Camille.&quot; I said. I handed her the picture. She 
        looked at it and smiled, &quot;good friends,&quot; she said, handing it 
        back. Then she looked at the box, held up a finger, took off her necklace 
        and gave it to me. I put it on. I felt so bad taking it and having nothing 
        to give in return. I searched through my bag and found a little money 
        pouch that I had gotten from Jane: this would be sufficient until, I don't 
        know, I got a chance to do something more. After that we talked: I pulled 
        other things out of my bag, she told me she was afraid of cats, I tried 
        to tell her I was afraid of spiders. When I said something and she understood 
        she would be so happy. She loved to speak English; she loved to think 
        she was good. She was good. </p>
      <p>I was amazed at how confident and brave she was. I spoke no Turkish, 
        she spoke some English, but she never got intimidated even when I didn't 
        understand, which was often. She spoke fast. Later I found out that the 
        Turkish language is the opposite of English: like when you say 'I want 
        to go to the store' you really say 'the store to go I want'. It seems 
        like it would be really hard to learn English.</p>
      <p>Turkey is an Islamic country. They pray five times a day and fast for 
        one month every year. The month when they fast is called &quot;Ramazan.&quot; 
        They fast to learn self-control. Biyram is the holiday after Ramazan. 
        Biyram is sort of like a mix between Halloween and Thanksgiving: people 
        dress-up in their nicest clothes and go around to people's houses where 
        they would be given candy and baklava. Then they would leave.</p>
      <p>I cried the night before we left. Though I was set on going back to Nida's 
        (our Servas host's) house for Biyram in a few weeks (we were invited). 
        I would miss Fatma. I wanted to see her. It was weird to think I might 
        never see her again. But I would. I would make sure we went back for Ramazan 
        festival. So I didn't miss her too much.</p>
      <p><br>
        <font size="5">Her House</font></p>
      <p>Fatma's mother must have been a decorator, but then, most Turkish houses 
        were very put together, not like mismatched items thrown together. Even 
        the couches matched. Even in Guzelyurt (a small town of 4,000 people, 
        where people didn't have enough money to get new couches) the houses were 
        very nice and matching. </p>
      <p>We did come back for Biyram, though I had little to do with it. I would 
        have pushed if it had come to that but everyone else wanted to go back 
        too so I didn't.</p>
      <p>Fatma and her family had celebrated Biyram by eating dinner at Nida's 
        the night before so we went to Fatma's house to see them. </p>
      <p>Every time I don't know someone so well, the fact that I don't know everything 
        about them, makes me afraid to open up and say something. Between Fatma 
        and me there was still this awkwardness and so, she was strictly &quot;family 
        of a friend&quot; again. We ate baklava, drank tea and sat until it was 
        time to go. Then in the hall on the way out someone asked, &quot;can Annie 
        do a sleep over?&quot; I had completely forgotten about that (my parents 
        and I had talked about that earlier). My shyness wiped it from my mind. 
        And I have to admit, I was a little nervous to do a sleep over. What would 
        we do? But now that they said it, I could hardly say, 'no, I don't want 
        to,' and besides, a little part of me was saying 'you want to see her 
        and get to know her so now's your chance.' I took it. I was going to stay 
        there and after my parents went to Fatih's cabin, they would bring some 
        of my stuff. </p>
      <p>When I entered Fatma's room I remember thinking, 'It's so clean!' The 
        beds were made. There was nothing on the floor. Turkish people are like 
        that. Maybe it's because they have more time. They don't seem to work 
        eight hours a day. For a while, we just sat there and talked. Then she 
        did something that surprised me very much - Turkish people seem very quiet 
        and subdued - she put on the music. Her sister started singing into a 
        hairbrush and she took my hands and started to dance. We were jumping 
        on the beds and twirling around to a fast, rock and roll type of music. 
        They started to teach me a Turkish song but it was too hard.</p>
      <p>For the Muslim people the path of what is right is very narrow. Strict 
        Muslims pray 5 times a day and can't drink alcohol. I just sort of figured 
        that dancing and jumping around and yelling was in the category of &quot;off 
        the path.&quot; </p>
      <p>She invited her friend over and we talked some more and danced a lot 
        more. They all said I danced beautifully but I shouldn't be shy. They 
        acted like any American kids would but with one exception: if ever I wanted 
        anything, it would be there. I could get up to dance but I couldn't get 
        up to get a glass of water or anything. They would get it for me.</p>
      <p>When the doorbell rang it was like they had been caught doing something 
        bad. They ran to turn off the music; then ran to get the door, all the 
        time giving each other looks of, 'uh oh'. It was more Ramazan visitors. 
        Fatma led them into the living room and her sister went to get the baklava. 
        I stayed in the bedroom with her friend: we weren't allowed to help. When 
        the guests left we went back to our dancing but the music was a little 
        less loud. We were ready when the next guests came. </p>
      <p>The music was off and we went to the door to greet them. When they came 
        in, Fatma's friend took no time in slipping out the door. I retreated 
        to the bedroom and was called out a few minutes later. We sat and they 
        asked me some questions, then they left. I had been wondering why her 
        friend left (she didn't say a word). Now I found out: none of them really 
        liked these people. Her friend wasn't obliged to stay so she left. I wondered, 
        'if they disliked these people, why do they invite them in and give them 
        things?' I guess it's just Turkish culture 'give to every one, no matter 
        what.' In the Koran (the Muslim bible) it says give away 2.5 percent of 
        what you have each year.</p>
      <p>She ran and got her friend again and we talked for a while. Then it was 
        time for bed. They lent me P.J.'s and, because of their yellow color, 
        said I looked like a yellow bird. We talked for a long time: about each 
        other, about America, about Turkey&#133;<br>
        We put shadows on the wall and when her mom yelled for us to go to sleep, 
        we turned out the light and used the flashlight. When we finally went 
        to sleep it was 2:00 a.m. and I had a really good friend.</p>
      <p>Every time think about her I smile but it is the kind of smile you have 
        when you remember a pet that died or a toy that broke. You remember how 
        happy you were then but it only makes you miss it more. I miss her. <br>

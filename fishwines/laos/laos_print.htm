            </font>End of April (Barbara)</b><br>
Well, I have decided to post no journals this time &#8211; not because I didn&#8217;t
write any (for I did &#8211; diligently writing many days), but because on looking
back at them, I realized that they were flat, with little feeling for myself
or the places I was. And then I looked at myself and realized that I have also
been a little flat, pulled back. Not depressed as in a morbid state, but depressed
as in a flattened state. </p>
          <p>I talked with Paul about it the other night;
              I called my journals &#8220;uninspired&#8221;. He read them and
              agreed (bummer!). I felt frustrated, didn&#8217;t know what was
              going on. Felt like I should post something, but didn&#8217;t want
              to just put the flatness out. Went to bed that night thinking about
              what was going on with me. I didn&#8217;t feel unhappy with the
              trip, nor overly happy either. Was it just homesickness, or something
              else? Was I just being lazy? How do you generate inspiration if
              what you are feeling is flat? And where does this flatness come
              from? </p>
          <p>Awoke the next morning with the following
              poem intact in my mind:</p>
          <p> <b>Husband and Family Arrested</b></p>
          <p>In the hotel lobby<br>
  Waiting for a taxi to the airport<br>
  Leaving India.<br>
  Third page, <br>
  Lower right corner of the paper, <br>
  A story caught my eye:<br>
  Husband and Family Arrested.<br>
  It told the tale of a young bride<br>
  Murdered<br>
  By her husband and his family. <br>
  The police found parts of her,<br>
  Stuffed in bags<br>
  Around their property. <br>
  It seems<br>
  The young bride&#8217;s family<br>
  Hadn&#8217;t paid her dowry <br>
  In a timely manner. </p>
          <p>Horrendous you say,<br>
  Shocking.<br>
  Yes of course,<br>
  I felt that too.<br>
  But it&#8217;s not my point<br>
  To shock you here.<br>
  No, I&#8217;m struggling here with something else -<br>
  The thing that really puzzles me,<br>
  That gnaws at something deep inside,<br>
  Is how they thought they&#8217;d get away with it.<br>
  I mean really,<br>
  What made them think<br>
  No one would even notice<br>
  That one day she was there;<br>
  The next day gone? </p>
          <p>Where did that come from? Suddenly it was
              so clear to me that for the past several months we have been in
              cultures that so clearly hold women second. And I have often felt
              invisible, a shadow behind Paul. A shadow that might easily disappear
              without notice if a cloud passed in front of the sun. Not mean
              cultures, not mean people, and perhaps not so dissimilar (though
              a little less subtle) from our American culture. But it has worn
              on me through this time and I have pulled back, flattened myself.
              And it has brought up feelings from my teenage years, feelings
              of pulling back. So, there it is, that&#8217;s a personal journey
              I&#8217;ve been experiencing while visiting all these exotic lands,
              one that clearly needs more exploring. So &#8230; this is the only
              journal I&#8217;ll include here. The others? &#8211; well, you&#8217;re
              not missing much by my omitting them. Enjoy Paul&#8217;s and I&#8217;ll
              tell you stories when we return. </p>
          <p><b>Friday, April 4th &#8211; minivan to Chaing
                Mai, Thailand</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
            Well, four days living with other meditators, novices, nuns,
                and monks practicing Buddhist meditation. It was more than any
                of us imagined before we came. The
  rooms, the food, the setting, the teachings, the lifestyle, the practice&#8230; For
  me the walking meditation was a metaphor for a new way of living. For one thing,
  there&#8217;s no destination other than the walk itself. And whatever you encounter
  on the walk, you stop, notice, acknowledge and walk on. It may be pain; it
  may be joy, an itch on your nose, an old memory. They are all impermanent.</p>
          <p>The sitting mediation was perhaps more interesting.
              The rising, falling of my stomach as I breathed brought many visitors
              and took me to many fantastic places. Maybe I&#8217;m a little
              bit closer to enlightenment but my mind is no less quiet yet. But
              of all the places to learn about hemorrhoids, this was it for me.
              Two of the main causes (I learned on the internet) &#8211; sitting
              for long periods and constipation &#8211; I was blessed with both
              in Chomthong. One more distraction to &#8220;notice and let go.&#8221;</p>
          <p>But Barbara is much more enlightened than
              I am having been around longer, having practiced Insight Meditation
              before, having a Buddhist predisposition and who-knows-what else
              in lives past. One night, in the sharing of our experiences with
              the 79 year old Thai Abbot (head monk) with Patra, our nun/teacher
              translating, Barbara delighted everyone with her story of feeling
              that her leg was empty for a fleeting moment during one of her
              walking mediations. She tried to no avail to get the feeling back. &#8220;Your
              ideas are different than most Europeans, wanting to experience
              that again,&#8221; said one of the monks. And her description of
              fear from an imaginary snake that entered her room during her sitting
              meditation brought a nod from the Abbot, &#8220;these kinds of
              vivid images show that your practice is strong.&#8221;</p>
          <p>But once, there was a young girl who traveled
              the world with her parents. She saw and experienced many things
              on this journey as her parents took her to this place and that.
              Once, in Thailand, she found herself in a Buddhist Temple living
              among people seeking enlightenment through obeying eight precepts
              and practicing meditation. She agreed to join in, not knowing much
              about Buddhism or mediation. The eight precepts were: abstain from
              1) killing or harming any living beings, 2) intoxication, 3) immoral
              behavior, bad language and lying, 4) jewelry and make up, 5) entertainment
              (including reading, writing, games, TV&#8230;), 6) eating after
              noon, 7) stealing, and 8) sleeping on a thick mattress.</p>
          <p>The first day was very difficult for her.
              The food was good, the surroundings beautiful, the teacher very
              nice and she actually enjoyed sleeping on the floor. But quieting
              her mind and giving up reading gave her much space to think about
              home: her grandma and grandpa, her friends, her cat &#8220;climber&#8221;,
              and the loving surroundings of Cohousing. She cried and cried.
              There was nowhere to hide form her thoughts.</p>
          <p>Discussing her difficulties with the teacher
              was a great relief. She said, &#8220;Perhaps you can obey five
              precepts which would allow you to eat after noon and do some reading
              and play games if you wish. Let&#8217;s see what the Abbot says.&#8221; </p>
          <p>But the Abbot had another way of thinking. &#8220;You
              should obey the eight precepts.&#8221; He said. &#8220;You should
              be on the same level of practice as your parents and your loneliness
              is impermanent as are all things. When you are lonely, think of
              the people in Africa and how much they suffer. Your loneliness
              is much less. And when you do this, you will understand suffering
              which will be of help to others who suffer. Can you do this?&#8221; He
              asked, smiling through his eyes as he sat holding his long fan
              in his comfortable chair perched next to many statues of the Buddha.</p>
          <p>&#8220;I will try,&#8221; nodded the girl
              kneeling before him in a line with her parents, hands held together
              in front of her.</p>
          <p>The next night, the family returned to the
              Abbot to report on their practice since seeing him last. After
              prostrating three times before the Buddha and three times before
              the Abbot, first the father, and then the mother reported their
              experiences of the last 24 hours.</p>
          <p>&#8220;and what about you?&#8221; said the
              Abbot, pointing at the girl with his long fan, his smile even bigger
              this time.</p>
          <p>&#8220;My practice is very good.&#8221; She
              started. &#8220;Yesterday, I was very lonely and I cried and cried,
              but today, during my mediations, I felt very happy and it was very
              nice.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Ah, you see,&#8221; said the Abbot, &#8220;you
              have learned the lesson of impermanence and at the same time, you
              have done a meritorious deed.&#8221;</p>
          <p><b>Wednesday, April 9 Muong Houn, Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
  Travel weary, for the past few days; I&#8217;m ready to go home. First time
  I&#8217;ve felt this strongly about it.</p>
          <p>First, Bush declared war. We were in India.
              While I loved India and was soaking up my experience there like
              a dry sponge, knowing that bombs were being dropped, something
              inside was calling me home &#8211; to familiar ground, to family
              and friends.</p>
          <p>Then Sars became front-page news. We had heard
              about the mysterious flu that had killed a few people but negotiating
              the crazy traffic in Bangkok seemed much more dangerous and we
              didn&#8217;t take it too seriously. But as the weeks have gone,
              so has the panic and it has yet to peak. Sars began in Hong Kong,
              700 miles as the flu flies from Kunming and Yunan Province, which
              is where we had planned to enter China from Laos. We began to seek
              more information and debate the options of staying the course,
              skipping China, going home early&#8230; I could see how excited
              Annie was with the prospect of getting home although, being the
              incredible trooper that she is, she&#8217;d never say, &#8220;I
              want to go home.&#8221; At the same time, I too could feel an excitement
              about being home and my mind began to drift to thinking about what
              I would do if we were home. </p>
          <p>Then in Chaing Mai, I discovered the joys
              of hemorrhoids. Mostly, I&#8217;ve taken this in stride but yesterday,
              after a 7 hour slow boat ride down the Mekong to Pakbeng with teak-plank
              seats and an international group of 30 other Lonely Planet carrying
              tourists, the discomfort, exacerbated by the oppressive April heat,
              put me over the edge. I wanted to be home. Now. I don&#8217;t want
              to observe people living any more; I want to BE a person living.
              I want my own bed, my own toilet, my own clothes&#8230;I want to
              be able to regulate my diet better. I&#8217;m sick of carrying
              this pack around and most of all; I want to live my life in my
              native tongue with friends and family (aside from my dear wife
              and daughter) who understand me more deeply than 3-syllabol sentences.</p>
          <p>This morning, we hopped in the back of a truck
              out of Pakbeng, off the river and deeper into Laos. The sky is
              thick with heat and moisture and smoke from the field burning that
              goes on this time of year. I know there&#8217;s a blue sky up there
              behind the gray that even obscures the sun. All day yesterday,
              on the boat, we could see the smoke and flames in the distance
              and black ashes as big as birds floated down to the river. Even
              now, black ash will drop on my journal as I write, sitting here
              on the porch of this small guesthouse in Moung Houn. The road was
              incredibly dusty too, making a shower and clothes-washing necessary
              when we arrived here after an hour-forty-five. </p>
          <p>But driving deeper into Laos, we began to
              see small villages, clusters of wood and woven bamboo houses up
              on stilts lining the road and rising up from the jungle. Laos looks
              very poor to me. Families and animals seek shade, living beneath
              the houses, where we see people weaving, eating, sleeping, washing&#8230; and
              lots of naked children waving to the passing truck. The houses
              are small but beautiful, with walls of the ubiquitous woven bamboo.
              We saw a fair number of them under construction.</p>
          <p>I began to imagine living in such a village
              for a few weeks, helping to build such a house, sharing food and
              life with Lao people as we have in so many places by now on this
              trip. Arriving in Muong Houn, we found a guesthouse (two rooms,
              $1 each), cleaned up, and walked through the market. Within 5 minutes,
              Annie&#8217;s kid-radar had detected how the kids dress and picked
              out the appropriate hand woven fabric for the right skirt ($3).
              This turned out to be the school uniform. With the help of our
              phrase book and hand gestures, we found our way to a tailor who
              would make a skirt for another dollar. So in a few hours, Annie
              would be at home here in a sense &#8211; smart kid.</p>
          <p>The phrase book is only marginally useful
              here as Lao is a tonal language. There are six different tones
              that will transform the same word into at least five others and
              it&#8217;s going to be difficult to get the hang of it.</p>
          <p>While Barbara shopped for material for a skirt
              of her own, Annie and I walked down the dirt road through the few
              rows of houses. The road ended in a pond with ducks swimming and
              a woman wading in up to her thighs to wash some woven bamboo baskets.
              With the stilt houses off to the left, the fields and palms in
              front and the hills receding into the distant haze, I felt as though
              we had just then arrived in Laos. We turned and continued walking
              for a few minutes before we were waived through the gate of one
              yard and into the sheltered area under the house to see a proud
              mother pushing a large swinging basket made of (you guessed it)
              bamboo with a pair of young, sleeping twin boys in it. They were
              less than 2 months, I&#8217;m guessing. &#8220;Twins&#8221; wasn&#8217;t
              in the dictionary and I wasn&#8217;t successful with my pronunciation
              of &#8220;beautiful&#8221; but I think we got across our delight.</p>
          <p>We sat and shelled these seedpods with them
              for about a half hour, had some tea and took off. We stopped at
              the tailor&#8217;s to find her working on Barbara&#8217;s skirt
              so we came back to the guest house for a nap &#8211; the heat grabbing
              all three of us (o.k, for the record, Annie didn&#8217;t sleep).</p>
          <p>Being some place new and interesting and imagining
              how we might be here for a few weeks, I can feel my juices beginning
              to flow again. Who knows, maybe I won&#8217;t try to talk Barbara
              and Annie into leaving tomorrow after all.</p>
          <p><b>Wednesday, April 16 &#8211; Luang Prabang,
                Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
            We arrived here four days ago and already the Lao New Year&#8217;s celebration
  had begun. It&#8217;s still in full swing. Our first introduction was a dousing
  with buckets of water as we rode the tuk-tuk from the boat landing to the guesthouse
  we&#8217;d reserved by phone from Muang Houn. $15 seemed incredibly high for
  Laos even though the room has a shower and bathroom in the room. But it&#8217;s
  New Years and Luang Prabang is the place to be. Every tourist in the country
  must be here including Lao people of course and many Thais. Room rates go way
  up at this time. </p>
          <p>The water dousing has been a constant part
              of the celebration as Lao kids and tourists tote their super-soaker
              squirt guns with backpacks that fill with water. But the most ruthless
              are the mobs of young Lao teens, mostly girls, who line the main
              roads and intersections with drums of water and buckets to pour
              on passing walkers, motorbikes, tuk-tuks full of passengers&#8230;whoever.
              It&#8217;s a great opportunity to go after adults, guys, friends,
              tourists&#8230;with full permission. And we&#8217;ve barely been
              able to keep up with dry clothes.</p>
          <p>The population of Luang Prabang is 16,500
              but I swear there are 50,000 people here as crowds walk the main
              streets day and night packing restaurants, buying from street vendors
              fried noodles or barbequed whole fish, chicken or sausage and perusing
              the Lao crafts &#8211; mostly beautiful, hand woven or embroidered
              fabric. The craftswomen have definitely adapted their craft to
              the tourists: hippy pants, bags and purses, quilt covers, wall
              hangings&#8230;there are so many weavers here selling their stuff.
              I can&#8217;t believe much of it will sell. We bought four pieces
              having fallen in love with a particular style &#8211; 15 day&#8217;s
              work for the women who sold us one for $ 5.</p>
          <p>So the place has been one constant street
              party reminiscent of spring break in Fort Lauderdale. I never did
              the trip but it was a popular trek for rich Jewish high school
              kids from my neighborhood as it seems for the English, French,
              German, Austrian and US tourists we&#8217;ve seen all over town.</p>
          <p>Even when it&#8217;s not the Lao New Year,
              Luang Prabang is a tourist destination. It&#8217;s a World Heritage
              Site, so designated by the United Nations and has been called the &#8220;best
              preserved city in SE Asia.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure if they were
              referring to the French colonial architecture or the so many Buddhist
              temples here but certainly it&#8217;s well preserved, I&#8217;m
              sure compared to Hanoi, Denang and other cities virtually destroyed
              by bombing during the Vietnam War years. </p>
          <p>But I think &#8220;World Heritage Status&#8221;,
              which has brought UN funding for 15 Lao, 2 French and 2 Thai architects
              and a host of street improvements and other preservation projects
              is the kiss of death or at least a double edged sward for such
              a place.</p>
          <p>Luang Prabang is quaint and with its western
              style street grid, sidewalks, restored temples, range of guesthouses,
              slew of Internet cafes, and low-low prices, any middle-class tourist
              would enjoy it here. And that means that so many Lao people are
              employed formally or informally in the tourist industry, making
              it more difficult to actually see Lao culture. It also means that
              you can get French food, Indian food, grilled cheese, ice cream
              and coke, making it necessary to check the menu first to make sure
              there&#8217;s Lao food served.</p>
          <p>But the dousing has been a blast and yesterday&#8217;s
              parade was also fun, reminiscent of our 4th of July with kid drummers,
              the tiger and long boat floats and a bunch of young and crazy Lao
              men at the end banging drums, dinking Beer Lao and dousing and
              getting doused.</p>
          <p>Two days ago, we hopped a boat across the
              Mekong along with thousands of other mostly young Lao people, theoretically
              to see the sand stupas being built but this turned out to be just
              the tip of the iceberg. Everyone wandered around in the sunny sand,
              eating, dousing and a new twist &#8211; powdering each other with
              handfuls of tapioca starch. We saw lines of people stretching as
              far as we could see climbing and descending the hill to the temple.
              When we got to the top, Annie commented on how few people were
              there compared to the throngs we boated over and climbed with.
              We later found them at an endless drinking/dance party that extended
              along the ridge beyond the temple. </p>
          <p>Once we&#8217;d had enough powder, water,
              baby mangos, sun and pounding dance music, we headed back. At some
              point in the so-far-four-day-long party, I realized that I kept
              looking for meaning. &#8220;I wonder what the water means? I wonder
              what the power means? The crossing of the river, or the ascent
              to the temple&#8230;&#8221; Then I thought, perhaps it&#8217;s
              just a bunch of fun in the April heat: Let loose, let go, play.</p>
          <p>Last night, I learned that there was a New
              Years blessing this morning at the top of the Phosy Temple on the
              hill in the middle of town. AJ wasn&#8217;t up for it so Barbara
              and I decided to go. Late last night a thunderstorm came through
              and it poured as we experienced on two other occasions in our 9
              days in Laos. This morning, the storm had moved on but it was still
              raining and thunder rumbled in the distance as we climbed the 300
              steps to the temple along with a steady flow of Lao families to
              pray for world peace, personal prosperity, family health and all
              the other things people pray for. Every few steps there was a pillar
              in the wall that lined the path up the hill. On these pillars,
              people place small clumps of sticky rice and candy (which the kids
              promptly grabbed and stuffed in their plastic bags carried for
              that purpose).</p>
          <p>At the top, we all, in turn, entered the temple,
              prostrated three times to the Buddha and offered our prayers and
              the small offerings of palm leaf and flowers that we&#8217;d bought
              at the bottom for 5,000 kip (50 cents). People lit candles, tossed
              candy as high as they could up the gold stuppa, kids ran around
              in search of candy, Monks in orange sat contemplatively on the
              walls looking out at the surrounding hills and the town below.</p>
          <p>The rain falling, the mist rising up the slopes
              of the hill, the temple and steps growing out of the lush foliage
              and dramatic rocks, and the offering of prayers seemed to be a
              nice counter balance to the craziness of the party soon to begin
              again in the streets of town below.</p>
          <p>Sure enough, on our walk back home, we could
              see the street vendors beginning to offload their goods and set
              up for another day of dousing, powdering, parading, drinking and
              such. We went back to get Annie, not bothering to put on dry clothes
              after our walk in the rain as we went back out to see what another
              day in Luang Prabang would bring.</p>
          <p><b>Saturday, April 19 &#8211; Ban Soupjem,
                Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
            Well, we&#8217;re here. We don&#8217;t yet know where &#8220;here&#8221; is.
  It&#8217;s a village. 56 houses and 375 people on the Nam Our River. It&#8217;s
  only accessible by boat and this morning we took the hour-long boat trip from
  Muang Ngoi with a guide, his four year-old son and boat driver. We left Muang
  Ngoi at about 9:30 am after the rain stopped, the weeklong New Year&#8217;s
  celebration winding down. The whole country, we&#8217;ve read, comes to a standstill,
  which means that the burning of crop fields also stops. That and the heavy
  rains that have come night and morning have left behind a blue sky dotted with
  ribbons of white clouds which hung in the valleys and climbed the lush mountains
  rising from the banks on both sides of the river. The boat cut through the
  quiet water toward the outside of the river&#8217;s bend, where the water is
  deeper. The air felt so clean as I sucked in deep breaths leaning back in the
  boat. The sun was low over our right shoulders as we headed north. Butterflies
  with wings as big as a child&#8217;s hands had replaced the floating ashes
  and we saw a beautiful, iridescent blue bird with white stripes on its wings
  fly and land, fly and land ahead of our slowly motoring long boat. It felt
  like the most beautiful place I&#8217;d ever been or ever seen. </p>
          <p>We motored up to a beach, a few children swimming
              on the river beach, forested rock and cliffs rising steeply on
              both sides of the river and we walked up to the village.</p>
          <p>Our English speaking Lao guide from Muang
              Ngoi found his friend Phouy right away. We entered his house and
              sat on the bamboo platform a foot and a half above the dirt floor
              as is typical in Lao houses. He explained our desire to stay with
              Phouy&#8217;s family for two weeks, to eat when and what they ate
              and help out where we could; for Annie to make friends and for
              all of us to learn some Lao. Within five minutes, a good 25 villagers
              of all ages had gathered to look in on the rare foreigners. But
              there seemed to be no questions about our mutual understanding
              and within a few minutes, our guide was off. He said he&#8217;d
              return in three days to see how everything was going. There are
              no phones here.</p>
          <p>Once again, we have found ourselves in the
              midst of community. When I think about the places we&#8217;ve been
              (like spinning the globe, eyes closed and plopping our finger down,
              only now it&#8217;s the real earth that&#8217;s spinning, our eyes
              are open and our feet that are plopping down), I&#8217;m amazed
              by the diversity: From inner city Sevilla, to stone villages in
              Central Turkey, to here. This may be the most picturesque and the
              laughter coming from downstairs and other nearby houses is one
              sign of a healthy community. This time, it&#8217;s big families,
              lots of ducks and chickens, river fisherman with nets and long
              boats, weavers of cotton fabric , farmers of lush fields and builders
              of bamboo houses. Some households have built dams on the stream
              flowing into the Nam Ou to generate electricity for their homes.
              Already, we&#8217;ve helped with dam building, cooking, setting
              fishing nets, attended religious ceremonies (Buddhist and Animist),
              drank Lao Lao, entertained bunches of kids, taught a card game
              and administered antibiotic ointment to a ton of scary looking
              lesions all over the body of a small boy (maybe 2 or 3 years old).
              He really needs a doctor but there isn&#8217;t one here and we
              presume the family is too poor for the several hour boat ride to
              Nong Kiaw. There&#8217;s no shortage of physical health problems
              here though as I&#8217;ve already noticed other kids with bad skin
              problems, some blindness, a guy with a severed arm, Phouy&#8217;s
              80 year-old. mom in bed all day with diarrhea and stomach pain&#8230;seems
              like a high percentage for a small village. Barbara and I talked
              about donating the money for a doctor to travel here for a day&#8217;s
              visit.</p>
          <p>The man we&#8217;re staying with is very sweet
              and we&#8217;ve already hit it off. His wife came back from the
              forest lat in the afternoon and his kids (the 3 of 4 who live here,
              the 4th is married and moved to her husband&#8217;s village) are
              shy so these will take more time. But Phouy is very outgoing and
              wants to learn English so we take turns teaching and learning.</p>
          <p>Annie seems really shy today too and it may
              take her a few days to let herself be scooped up by the kids here.</p>
          <p>So after about 10 days, we&#8217;ve finally
              landed in Laos, into the lap of some new friends-to-be, in a small
              bamboo village rising out of the sandy soil within the beautiful
              mountainous setting of the Nam Ou River valley in northern Laos,
              putting our lives in the hands of strangers (as my dad would say).</p>
          <p><b>Tuesday, April 22 &#8211; Ban Soupjem,
                Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
            This morning I woke up when Phouy and La walked downstairs. Phouy
                was going to wake me up at 5:30 to go bring in the fishnets.
                He didn&#8217;t say anything
  when he and his wife walked past our family bed on the floor under the mosquito
  net. I wondered if it was time. I checked Barbara&#8217;s watch. It was 2:09
  in the morning! I went back to sleep. Again I woke, this time at the sound
  of roosters crowing and the mechanical, rhythmic thud of a teeter tauter-like
  contraption the women step on to break the shells of the rice for hulling.
  Again, I checked the watch. It was 5:30 and Phouy stuck his head up from downstairs. &#8220;Sabai
  di, let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Somewhat groggy, I followed Phouy down to the water,
  got in the boat and paddled. The river was quiet, dawn was breaking and clouds
  wrapped the mountains as the two of us paddled over to the nets we had set
  last night at sunset. Two nets, no fish. In the 3 days we&#8217;ve been here,
  the nets have yielded 1, 5, and 0 fish.</p>
          <p>[I&#8217;ve just been distracted by a cat
              playing with and killing a rat on the platform next to me three
              feet away.]</p>
          <p>&#8220;no people, many fish. Many people,
              no fish?&#8221; I&#8217;m trying to ask if this is the result of
              over fishing. I guess Phouy thinks it&#8217;s a continuation of
              our English/Lao lesson that the two of us have been engaged in
              pretty much non-stop for 3 days. But on the way back, he said,
              in his emerging English (better than my Lao), &#8220;tonight, no
              go fishing.&#8221; </p>
          <p>After cleaning the nets we walked up and I
              did my yoga/breathing prayer/meditation routine &#8211; an hour
              and a half long hybrid of things I have been drawn to on the trip,
              mostly from India and Thailand. I came down to breakfast. Phouy
              told me to come with him to a neighbor&#8217;s, where we would
              pray.</p>
          <p>[the rat is half gone now. Cat showing no
              signs of slowing up]</p>
          <p>We entered to find, on the bamboo platform,
              about 10 men, one the father of the young boy with the bad skin
              problem. The sores all over his body make him itch and scratch
              and cry. The first day we were here, his mother brought him to
              us to show us and ask if we had medicine. We hgave her our tube
              of Neosporin, washed off the sores, which they had smeared with
              mud and put on the first application.</p>
          <p>[it just started pouring rain]</p>
          <p>The mother and child were also there, this
              morning&#8217;s prayers were for them.</p>
          <p>We were assembled around a small, low table
              that held a platter with a bowl of sticky rice, a pile of string,
              a bowl of raw rice and a bottle of the ever-present Lao Lao. Everyone
              put money into the raw rice bowl and put a hand on the table while
              Phouy&#8217;s brother, an animist priest, prayed out loud. Then
              everyone joined in, presumably in prayer as the words bounced around
              the room in a steady wash of Lao.</p>
          <p>[It just stopped raining]</p>
          <p>It was then that I realized that the prayers
              were for the child as each person took some string, tied it around
              the boys wrist, took some sticky rice or chicken and put it in
              his hand, and said their own prayer to him. &#8220;You be strong&#8221; I
              recognized. This was also showered onto both parents and a few
              strings and prayers were exchanged to others as well &#8211; Phouy
              and his uncle each gave one to me. Then a couple of shots of Lao
              Lao were given to the parents who sprinkled a drop of each shot
              on each shoulder of their son, one on his head, then downed the
              rest.</p>
          <p>The money bowl was given to the family, the
              table cleared and removed, food was set out on the floor of the
              platform and the Lao Lao flowed (I think I had five shots) as well
              as the Beer Lao. I was on the verge of tears when I realized how
              sweet this ceremony was &#8211; a community coming together to
              pray for and share their money with the family that needed help.
              I imagine in this place with no doctors and breaking all of our
              rules about hygiene, that many young children don&#8217;t make
              it through these childhood ailments, despite the sharing and the
              prayers. In any case, it&#8217;s this coming together, acknowledging
              the hardships, helping each other out, wishing and praying for
              the best and sharing food and ritual that sustains community.</p>
          <p>Breakfast consisted of deer soup (wild), cabbage
              and chicken soups and of course, sticky rice. It often looks like
              food is from last night or last week, it&#8217;s hard for me to
              tell what the food is, everyone eats from the same bowl and now
              I&#8217;m witnessing how the platform cum &#8220;dining table&#8221; is
              shared by the cat eating a rat. </p>
          <p>But the sticky rice is the scariest. It lasts
              for days if not weeks and is grabbed by the handful, hands used
              for everything you can imagine and &#8220;washed&#8221; in a common
              bucket, no soap, dried on a dirty towel. Sticky rice is eaten by
              grabbing a small handful, compressing it into a ball and dipped
              into a hot pepper mixture or the other food in shared bowls. After
              the meal, whatever sticky rice isn&#8217;t eaten is mashed back
              into the basket for the next meal.</p>
          <p>[The cat just walked away from the tail and
              a little piece of fir, all that&#8217;s left of the rat. Should
              I throw the tail outside?]</p>
          <p>I have to say that I enjoyed the combination
              of soups, the spicy peppers, and the sting of the Lao Lao. I&#8217;m
              glad for the prayers for strength I received this morning and I
              just hope that I don&#8217;t need them. I&#8217;m hoping we make
              it through the next two weeks without getting too sick.</p>
          <p><b>Saturday, April 26th &#8211; Ban Soupjem,
                Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
            Just got back from &#8220;fai faa&#8221; (electricity). About a kilometer up
  a stream that flows into the Nam Ou at the east end of the village, Phouy is
  installing a small hydro turbine that will supply 2 families with electricity
  for a few fluorescent light bulbs and one for his guest house. He sells electricity
  to one family at 60 cents per month. As we headed up there, we strung electrical
  wire for another guy (he, Phouy and I) who bought Phouy&#8217;s old turbine.
  The coconut trees are the power poles as, now, the wires for about 15 different
  turbines along the creek head down main street and criss-cross the valley.
  It&#8217;s crazy. Annie and I counted one night and about 40% of the village
  has electricity. I think they&#8217;re ready for some kind of network and I
  wish I could go back to that small-scale hydro class I took at Berkeley and
  ask some questions. </p>
          <p>For one thing, Phouy has spent about half
              the time we&#8217;ve been here working on installing his new turbine.
              The whole concept is new. All the other turbines are sitting in
              the fast water pouring out the spillway of the three-foot-high
              dams people have built. The spinning fins create electricity but
              not enough (or something) for Phouy. He, with the help of some
              other guys in the village, dug an 18&#8221; wide trench that runs
              about 100 meters through the jungle beside the creek taking water
              out of the creek and putting it back in at the other end of the
              trench. At it&#8217;s entry point, it goes into a wooden box in
              the trench and through the turbine which sits tightly into a wooden
              pipe that took a good solid four days to make. After all that:
              the dam, the trench, the box, the pipe, the turbine, the wire,
              the days of work, the cost of the turbine and the wire (everything
              else came from the woods: the raw wood, the bamboo, even the tree
              sap that&#8217;s rushed up and made into caulking for the joints
              in the pipe and the box) for 10 light bulbs. And each day, we&#8217;ve
              gone up there, there have been breaks in the trench to be fixed,
              leaves stuck in the turbine and other repairs and modifications
              to be made.</p>
          <p>After doing some modifications to the turbine
              and cleaning out leaves, we went up to the dam to check it out,
              plug some holes and add some rocks. The dam is at a beautiful spot
              in the valley where it narrows to about fifteen feet and rises
              up on either side to the green-draped limestone cliffs. I swam
              up the valley a few hundred feet and noticed another group of four
              guys working on another turbine and another dam. The bearings had
              jammed and they had somehow, somewhere, found some replacements
              and were fixing it as well as making modifications to the dam structure.</p>
          <p>I thought, could this possibly be worth it?
              All this work for a few flickering fluorescent light bulbs instead
              of candles and oil lanterns?</p>
          <p>I noticed the color the afternoon sun rendered
              the narrow green of the valley, the still water of the creek upstream
              of the dam. I felt cool standing or swimming in the creek despite
              the heat of the Lao afternoon in this hottest month of the year.
              It occurred to me, as a boy, as for these boys: what could be better
              than using sharp hand tools and found materials up the creek, in
              the woods, no permits, no building codes, no inspectors&#8230; No
              one would think of asking the boys to apply a cost-benefit analysis
              to the building of a fort or tree house and I can&#8217;t help
              thinking that that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here. And in the
              process, the houses get built, light is provided, enough food is
              caught or produced and life goes on.</p>
          <p>Day before yesterday, when we got the turbine
              installed for the first time, and it sat upright emerging from
              the box, the water pouring from the trench, through the turbine
              and frothing out the bottom of the pipe, all against the backdrop
              of the beautiful valley, I sat alone waiting for Phouy to return
              from the house to report on whether the juice was flowing. A few
              village women and girls walked by, having spent the day gathering
              bamboo shoots for the next few days&#8217; meals. They just walked
              by. Then a half-dozen guys cam, practically running through the
              trail from the village, excited to see the results of all this
              work and the new design. Smiles, arms waiving, animated debate
              about the methods, the execution. I couldn&#8217;t understand what
              they said but there was no mistake about their excitement. </p>
          <p>This thing would never pass a cost benefit
              analysis. It won&#8217;t bring in much-needed food or money and
              won&#8217;t appreciably improve the quality of life for Phouy&#8217;s
              family or the other family on Phouy&#8217;s grid but, hey, it&#8217;s
              been a lot of fun!</p>
          <p><b>Tuesday, April 29th &#8211; Ban Soupjem,
                Laos</b> <b>(Paul)</b><br>
  The pig stopped squealing. I just walked over to see if it was being slaughtered
  but it had just calmed down. A young mad just carried it over to another house
  and tied it by its leg to a post under the house.</p>
          <p>Phouy said many people had gone to their rice
              fields today and it does seem quieter than usual. Phouy is repairing
              his net, his daughter (Dawn Kian &#8211; 8) is rubbing oil on his
              back. With a few young girls watching, Eun Huean (his other daughter &#8211; 15)
              is working on the loom , taking her turn on the fabric she and
              Annie are weaving. One of the girls looks about 9, has a 1-&frac12; year
              old slung on her back. Everyone here carries kids this way. Until
              about 2, kids don&#8217;t seem to be put down except to sleep when
              they swing in bamboo baskets hung from the rafters. After that,
              the kids seem entirely unsupervised. The boys go fishing, run around
              and watch the men while the girls stick together, go swimming,
              do more than there share of carrying kids and help their moms.
              There is a school here in Soupjem that takes care of the 1st and
              2nd grade. After that, kids have to paddle to another village,
              stop school altogether, or stay in Muang Ngoi during the week as
              Khom On (Phouy&#8217;s son &#8211; 13) does, paddling at 5 am on
              Monday morning. Most stop school after 2nd grade. It&#8217;s really
              sweet to see the kids walking up to the school at 7 am with a wad
              of sticky rice and their little blackboards on a string (paper
              and pencils are too expensive for many of the kids).</p>
          <p>A few women are smashing rice with the rhythmic
              Ka-chunk, Ka-chunk stop-release, step-release on their rice crushers
              and others are tossing the rice, shhik-shhik, the next stop in
              the process, in round, flat baskets, to let the wind catch the
              broken hulls. Many people, kids, chickens (lots of kids and chickens)
              ducks&#8230;walk slowly up and down the main street of the village.
              Actually, it&#8217;s a wide path. There are no cars or even any
              wheels in the village. The only way to get here is by boat on the
              Nam Ou or by foot from the steep surrounding hills. At one end
              of the village is the Nam Ou river beach, at the other is a creek. </p>
          <p>The pace of life is slow and steady. Carrying
              water, processing rice, weaving, repairing nets, slicing and stripping
              bamboo for making baskets&#8230; It&#8217;s all slow, steady, rhythmic,
              repetitious work that&#8217;s done every day. Socializing is part
              of all of it and there&#8217;s always a group of kids playing in
              the river and often a group of women bathing with their tube skirts
              pulled up over their breasts.</p>
          <p>All of this creates a collective sound of
              happiness, despite the occasional unhappy pig or crying baby. The
              sound begins with the roosters at about 4 am, well before the sun
              rises. At 5 or so, the rhythm of women crushing rice begins. Last
              night, well past 10 pm, Barbara and I marveled at the sound of
              all the conversations going on simultaneously within earshot. Woven
              bamboo walls keeps out the heat but do little to filter sound.</p>
          <p>Barbara and I walked and swam up river a ways
              today and looked up to see the yellow bamboo buildings of the village
              up off the river, surrounded by the dramatic green and rock peaks.
              What a place this is, so isolated from the rest of the world. Phouy&#8217;s
              mom is 80 and I think about the changes most 80 year old Americans
              have experienced from clogged freeways to TV&#8217;s, cell phones,
              airplanes&#8230; Soupjem has seen none of this. Recently, the industrious
              have hooked up hydro generators to light bulbs in the houses and
              one guy powers a VCD. He has set up the area below his house as
              a sort of village theatre and shows Lao VCD&#8217;s, which add
              to the sound of the evening, but three&#8217;s no TV reception.</p>
          <p>Whenever we sit outside like this, writing,
              reading, watching Annie weave or Phouy repair his nets, people
              gather, mostly kids, staring at us strange creatures &#8211; or
              at least that&#8217;s how it feels. Actually, us being here may
              increase the gathering some but it&#8217;s clear that this &#8220;main
              street&#8221; is for gathering. It and the beach are the community
              spaces. But people gather inside too. Informally in the evenings
              after dinner and for special meals or ceremonies. </p>
          <p>The other morning, Phouy brought me to a house
              on the other end of the village where 15 or so men sat, legs crossed
              in a circle on the bamboo floor several steps up off the ground.
              We at breakfast together: &#8220;samakhi&#8221; &#8211; deer soup
              sticky rice, Lao Lao&#8230; a way to share food with people who
              have no food or money Phouy said. The women are excluded from this
              sharing and I find that disturbing. The other night, the village
              held a ceremony for Barbara, AJ and I for our having bought mosquito
              nets to give to families who can&#8217;t afford them. Similar to
              the other ceremonies we&#8217;d been to, we were blessed with prayers,
              string tied to our wrists, Lao Lao, beer Lao, chick and sticky
              rice. But again, no women except those being blessed. Of course
              they cooked these meals but the saddest thing for me is that none
              of their blessings are added to these ceremonies.</p>
          <p>Food and money come day by day here &#8211; spending
              the day gathering bamboo, mushrooms or other wild vegetables from
              the forest will last for a few meals, fishing, when there&#8217;s
              something in the nets will also last a few days. Only sticky rice
              seems to be cooked in batches that last for more than 2 or 3 days.</p>
          <p>I went back over to check out the pig as the
              squealing picked up and I saw several boys heading over. Sure enough
              it was this little pigs time to go. Right on the front steps of
              the house on &#8220;main street.&#8221; With a small crowd of boys,
              three men tied the pigs feet together, bound it&#8217;s mouth shut,
              held it down and stuck the knife into its throat, draining the
              blood into a small boy that a boy stirred constantly. The pig squealed
              and squirmed and then jerked longer than I expected it to after
              its blood was drained and then went limp. </p>
          <p>The boys and I took off back to what each
              of us had been doing. I walked beside two boys &#8211; about 7
              or 8 years old &#8211; as I headed back the few hundred feet to
              Phouy&#8217;s house. &#8220;Ngoi Mu&#8221; I said (little pig)
              to the boys as I walked and they skipped. One of them replied a
              few words but all I caught was his skipping, his big smile, his
              excited tone of voice and the word &#8220;kin&#8221; (eat). I wouldn&#8217;t
              be surprised to be taken by Phouy to eat some of the little pig
              at another samakhi sometime in the next few days.</p>

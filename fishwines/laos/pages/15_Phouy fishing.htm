<p><b>Phouy fishing</b><br>
  Ban Soupjem is a subsistence fishing/farming village and we landed here at
    the home of Phouy and La and their family. Phouy and Paul struck up a great
    friendship and Phouy took Paul out fishing most every evening (to lay the
    nets) and every morning (to pull the nets in). Paul was probably more company
    than help, since as you can see in this photo, Phouy is capable of precariously
    balancing at the end of his narrow boat to both lay the net and paddle the
    boat at the same time. <br>

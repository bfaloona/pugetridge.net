<p><b><font size="+1">Weaving with Marcela</font></b>,<b><font size="+1"> by Annie</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>My mom came home from Spanish school. &quot;Would you like to learn to weave 
  with me?&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; I said. Little did I know it would be the beginning 
  of a friendship I would never forget.</p>
<p><img src="images/annie_weaving_pic1.jpg" width="233" height="225" align="left" hspace="8">Marcela 
  lived in a one-room dirt floor house. With an unattached tool shed beside it. 
  She was 16 years old and lived with her mother and sister, 2 dogs and a number 
  of chickens.</p>
<p>In Todos Santos there are a lot of stray dogs. We were told it was because 
  people didn't have enough money to feed them. They put them on the street where 
  they lived among garbage, eating everything and getting kicked around by everyone. 
  Where the sidewalks were too small and shelter was scarce, all were wet with 
  the frequent rain.<br>
  Not so with Marcella. She loved her dogs. </p>
<p>The women in Todos Santos wore shawls to keep warm. I had been admiring one. 
  It was blue, green, purple and white. When Marcella told us, &quot;pick 5 colors, 
  &quot; I had no trouble. She took the colors and tied them in a little bundle. 
</p>
<p>Then we had to buy yarn, so she took us to the market. She led us down and 
  around and up and over shops selling everything from shoes to plastic laundry 
  baskets, to pork and beef and looms and string. All this was spread out on the 
  ground, tables, shelves, chairs, anything. When you passed, people would hold 
  out stuff or look at you hopefully. Then you would be consumed in the crowd 
  and swept away. The market was there every day but Saturday was market day: 
  when all the people came.</p>
<p><img src="images/annie_weaving_pic2.jpg" width="267" height="215" align="right" hspace="8">When 
  we finally got to the place where we would buy yarn she pulled out our sample 
  colors and matched them up to the yarn on the rack. We needed one more thing: 
  a small twisted nylon textured string. It was two quetzales, the Guatemalan 
  money (1=about 15 cents), too much by her standards. So we went to three more 
  stores looking for it and didn't find any. We went back and bought it. She was 
  really worried it was too much: 30cents! </p>
<p>Then we had to wind. It took all day to wind mine, my mom and I winding. The 
  string came in a big loop tied in a knot. You fit the loop on a rack that twirled 
  on a stick and wound the string into a ball. The string, rubbing on my hand, 
  wore it raw. My mom said it was because I have young skin, but Marcela had been 
  weaving since she was 10. I couldn't even imagine. After a while, I couldn't 
  wind at all. I suppose you would get used to it though. In the U.S. the yarn 
  would probably come wound but in Todos Santos it would cost more and people 
  couldn't afford it. I enjoyed doing it all.</p>
<p>The next day, I returned with a bandage on my hand, hoping that we wouldn't 
  do any more winding. My mom thought that we wouldn't get anything done. She 
  decided it would be better if I wove and she watched. We explained this to Marcella 
  in our broken Spanish. It took a while but she finally understood.</p>
<p><img src="images/annie_weaving_pic3.jpg" width="172" height="231" align="left" hspace="8">When 
  she pulled out a big wooden board with pegs on it, my heart rose. No More Winding! 
  It was fun at first, but after a while it got boring. </p>
<p>I wove the thread over, under, around; under, over, around, on the wooden pegged 
  board all day. It was very calming. I got into a rhythm. It was a bouncy but 
  controlled rhythm that no song could catch. It reminded me of a river lapping 
  at the rocks but ever flowing in the same direction: over, under, around; under, 
  over, around. The work went fast.<br>
</p>
<p>It was on this day that I decided that the black dog was my favorite. He seemed 
  to be ignored a lot. When I tried to give him some attention the other dog came 
  running up, tackled him and stuck his nose under my hand. He is an attention 
  hog.</p>
<p>As I returned the next day Marcella came and we embraced each other. It took 
  me a while to get used to this. I loved it but it was so unroutine and different 
  from our culture. The warm smell of earth, animals, corn and sun filled my nose. 
  I loved that smell, so warm and comforting. This 16-year-old girl had worked 
  her way into my heart. I loved her and she loved me. She was my friend and it 
  didn't matter if we could only speak Spanish. When I have a good friend I tend 
  to think that they're so wonderful and beautiful and I can't believe that they 
  would be so kind as to let me, being so dull in comparison, be their friend. 
  It was like this with Marcella. She was so kind and open and loving. I wish 
  I could be like that. Love every one, not care if it was weird to show affection. 
  I wish I could see her more often.<br>
</p>
<p>Then she took my thread off the pegged board and tied the ends so it wouldn't 
  come undone, put it in a pot and poured ground corn in boiling water over it. 
  Then she stretched it out and hung it in the sun. I was amazed at how much work 
  it took to make something that Marcela would sell for five dollars. And though 
  I thought there were better ways to do things, this was the way it was done, 
  generation after generation, mother teaching daughter, time and again. It is 
  so easy to do things in the U.S., weaving is almost all done by machine.</p>
<p><img src="images/annie_weaving_pic4.jpg" width="178" height="237" align="right" hspace="8">Marcela 
  said if we returned in the afternoon, my loom would be done sunning.</p>
<p>Marcela said she spoke little Spanish (more than us). it was nice though to 
  have a slow talker who used simple words as a teacher. Todos Santos is made 
  up mostly of the Mam indigenous people. Until recently, they only spoke their 
  own language, &quot;Mam.&quot; But they are slowly converting.</p>
<p>When we came back that afternoon I was tired. We had just made the steep hike 
  to &quot;Las Leteras,&quot; the letters. Someone decided to write the name of 
  the town in white rocks on the side of one of the surrounding mountains. You 
  couldn't read it any more but the view was amazing. You could see the whole 
  town and there were trees all around. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>Now it was time to set up the loom. I had been at this for three days and I 
  hadn't even started to weave yet! It took almost all my concentration to understand 
  what she said, let alone remember what to do. It was a complicated process, 
  and I remember little of what we did (or she did).<br>
</p>
<p>Her fingers danced through the strings. She made it look so easy. It wasn't. 
  I can hardly remember what to do.</p>
<p>The next day, I learned, finally, to weave. It was a cool sunny day. I sat 
  in the sun listening to the light, rustle rustle, of the corn stalks in the 
  cool breeze. It pulled me into its rhythm. The strings held the rhythm and asked 
  my fingers to dance. I listened as my mom read my book and talked to Marcella. 
  I felt as if I could just sit there and weave forever. When I finally pulled 
  out of my trance, I marveled at how much I had done. But when I stood, my feet 
  ached. I hadn't even noticed them at all.</p>

    <p>Passing cement - while we were in Edayansathu village, a new road was being 
      built. Under the Panchayat system, the village prioritizes their needs and 
      the government provides the funding for projects (after a great deal of 
      pressure). Here are village women passing bowls of concrete from the mixer 
      to the leading edge of the pour. Village women are paid about 75 rupees 
      a day ($1.50) for their work. The pour will last two days and everyone is 
      happy: Self-Help village improvement and employment.</p>

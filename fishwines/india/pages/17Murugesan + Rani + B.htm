    <p>Murugesan, Rani and B - the driving forces behind much of the positive 
      change in Edayansathu village are Rani (left) who gained confidence and 
      experience in Self-Help Groups and eventually was elected to be the president 
      of her village panchayat; and Murugesan, the project Director of SHARE which 
      has created SHG's with over 3,000 women in over 50 villages. We spent much 
      time with these two and their families. We were well taken care of! We were 
      also able to contribute some by photographing all of the craft products, 
      designing a web site for SHARE and putting together a nomination of Rani 
      for best Panchayat President in India.</p>

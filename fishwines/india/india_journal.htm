              <p align="left"><font color="#0000FF">Last day in Ethiopia. We leave 
                tomorrow morning, and though its time to go, I'm not sure I'm 
                fully ready. I've become more comfortable in Addis - as Paul says, 
                I now have a favorite coffee place here. Our 3 days here have 
                been more focused than when we arrived. The first day I spent 
                walking around (with the minor purpose of changing our airline 
                tickets &amp; checking out the swimming pools at the Hilton &amp; 
                Sheraton), so I started to know where things were in the city, 
                got comfortable finding my way around. Strange to be in the big 
                hotels - such a painful contrast with the poverty around us. We 
                didn't stay there, but did go back to swim for the day - Annie 
                really needed a play day. She got a bit sunburned &amp; I felt 
                like a bad mom. So paranoid about that even after all the intense 
                sunburns I got as a kid. Today, AJ &amp; I went to our favorite 
                coffee place for breakfast while P went to Internet. Then we went 
                to UN to see Terkle's stained glass window (beautiful) &amp; to 
                try to talk to someone there (no success). Then to bookstore &amp; 
                buying some baskets for gifts in India. Many small things done, 
                good to have a purpose. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">So what is not complete? The steps have 
                all been done. I think there is a poem here that has not been 
                written. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF"><b>To the boy who wears flip-flops on his 
                hands <br>
                because his legs don't work:</b></font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">I wish now <br>
                I had a photograph of you,<br>
                Because I liked your smile<br>
                And your bright eyes;<br>
                And after a while,<br>
                That's what I saw.<br>
                Not your jerky crabwalk<br>
                That embarrassed me at first,<br>
                So that I looked away. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">And though I gave you money<br>
                Once or twice,<br>
                What I really wanted <br>
                Was to sit with you and talk<br>
                Or maybe even have a cup of tea.<br>
                And sometimes <br>
                Late at night before I slept,<br>
                I tried to imagine if you could even sit<br>
                To hold a cup of tea. <br>
                I wondered what you ate, <br>
                Where you bathed,<br>
                Where you slept,<br>
                And how you managed all the other<br>
                Little movements of life<br>
                That come to me so easily.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Now, without a photograph,<br>
                This poem will have to hold<br>
                Your jerky crabwalk,<br>
                Your bright eyes<br>
                And the lost chance of having shared <br>
                A cup of tea. </font></p>
              <p> <b><font color="#FF0000">Thursday, February 13th - Chennai (Paul)</font></b></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">I love India. We've been here for a day 
                and a half but I've drawn my conclusion. Of course I hate mosquitoes. 
                Last night, they kept me awake and we could see them literally 
                swarming even as we lined up to go through immigration last night 
                in the airport. Ethiopia desensitized us to poverty and to the 
                smell of piss. So, here in Chennai, we see right through that 
                layer to a bustling, colorful, thriving city of 5-12 million people 
                (depending on who you ask) on the shore of the Indian Ocean. In 
                fact, that's one of my favorite parts. Tonight and last, we went 
                out to the beach which clearly an integral part of the city where 
                literally thousands of people 5 or 10 deep stood lining the share 
                at day's end while the most playful ran partly or entirely into 
                the crashing waves fully or partially clothed. Food vendors, fisherman 
                selling seashells and the assorted entrepreneurs had booths selling 
                all kinds of stuff. Kites flew, families sat and ate, sacred cows 
                lounged, big groups of boys and big groups of girls ran and laughed 
                together in the sand. Several groups asked to take a picture of 
                us with their cameras. It was wonderful. And of course, the streets 
                are an insane chaotic mess of cars, busses, cycle and auto rickshaws 
                (50,000 of these one driver told us), motorcycles and pedestrians. 
                It seems like it all happens in fast motion, spilling over into 
                oncoming traffic and back - tolerances in the millimeters and 
                fractions of seconds.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The overall tone here, at least to me, 
                seems to be a happy one but again, how much of that is a reflection 
                of my mood or our recent experience of Ethiopia, who knows. But 
                we are at once struck by unexpected human beauty having braced 
                ourselves for the opposite: the saris, bangles, nose jewels&#133;worn 
                by women of all classes, the amazingly elaborate sculpture and 
                statues of the Jain and Hindu temples within the city, the flower 
                arrangements put together in the bazaar into large necklaces that 
                we've seen draped over public art (metal stairs are placed next 
                to many of the statues around the city to make this easier). The 
                City itself is not much to speak about: low and dense, certainly 
                not pedestrian friendly, with much of the infrastructure and many 
                of the buildings old and near crumbling. But even that, with the 
                density of eclectic styles and big signage creates a visual richness 
                that I have to say I actually like.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The three of us enjoyed riding around the 
                city together in the back of a &quot;tuk tuk&quot; (auto rickshaw) 
                feasting on the visual show going by, adrenalin rushing as we 
                were nearly hit and nearly hit others over and over. We enjoyed 
                the forty-cent plate of Indian food on the beach. We enjoyed romping 
                in the waves and exchanging &quot;hellos&quot; with many friendly 
                people. A great start to our visit. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Tomorrow, we're off to Vellore to stay 
                with our first Indian Servas host a two-hour train ride (with 
                only two hours, we decided to give second class a try) to see 
                a smaller town and some villages and to scope out potential places 
                for an extended visit. My biggest hope is to find a place were 
                Annie can fit in and enjoy herself - perhaps other girls, crafts, 
                animals - the tings she loves. I know Barbara and I will do well 
                here.</font></p>
              <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Friday, February 14th - Adukamparai 
                (Barbara)</font></b></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Valentines day: Took the train early this 
                morning from Chennai to Vellore to visit the SHARE project. What 
                a heartwarming place, what beautiful, strong woman, what rich 
                &amp; earthy crafts. We are lucky to be here. I didn't originally 
                want to come - it seemed out of the way &amp; the tour book gave 
                a pretty bad review of the city. But P had done a lot of correspondence 
                with the director here &amp; really wanted to come &amp; see what 
                their program was (empowering village women to economic independence 
                by teaching them crafts to sell in the international market). 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">So we bought train tickets yesterday (#2 
                each - second class - trains are cheap here) &amp; took the early 
                morning train. I've come to dread these transportation days - 
                the unknown arena of where to go, what to do, where can our backpacks 
                go &amp; are they safe, who to tip and how much, who to believe 
                when we ask a question and get five answers, all the slight tensions 
                that put us all a bit on edge. But this morning all went well. 
                Got to the station in plenty of time, met a man (Matthew) who 
                helped us find our seats, train only about half full so we even 
                had extra seats - plenty of room for our backpacks near us. Only 
                Annie struggled - itchy all over, maybe a reaction to her bug 
                bites, maybe the heat, or maybe both. An antihistamine seemed 
                to clear it up with time, or maybe it was just the time and the 
                antihistamine just made me feel like I was doing something to 
                help. But anyhow, half-hour out of Chennai &amp; she was feeling 
                OK too. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Arrived in Vellore &amp; were met by Guru, 
                one of the SHARE staff people. Took us in their jeep to the project 
                office, just outside of town. It was so luxurious driving in a 
                private vehicle. Must admit that I love the luxury - to be able 
                to go whenever &amp; wherever we want. In Ethiopia, I looked longingly 
                at the campers that pulled into our hotel courtyard to spend the 
                night. Yes, I'd like to travel that way - I love the self contained 
                independence &amp; I don't take well the uncertainty of public 
                transit &amp; I hate to look out the dirty dusty windows of a 
                bus &amp; see all the photos I'm missing. So yes, I could travel 
                that way. But we aren't. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">SHARE has a small complex of buildings 
                - a small prayer room (Muslim, Hindu &amp; Christian), a guesthouse, 
                a craft storage room, a main office, another storage room, a craft 
                making room, a daycare, &amp; a craft research room. Clean, white 
                buildings, simple but with small inspired touches, a happy place 
                to be. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">And the women, their bright energy, their 
                rainbow of colors, their warm smiles. Talking, laughing, hands 
                moving automatically and magically a star appears, or a basket, 
                or a woven garland. We sit with them all afternoon, they teach 
                us to weave too &amp; laugh at our mistakes. Annie jumps right 
                in - she's a natural &amp; they love it. She shines. </font></p>

                to brag a little. It's in the human nature to brag.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">I've started getting gifts for my friends. 
                I can't wait to be home! Misty didn't reply to my e-mail. What

                would love it here, I think. Spending time with these women, contributing,

              <p><font color="#0000FF">Spent a busy day photographing the women

                the photos have turned out quite good. So many more to take. I'm

                friendly &amp; inspiring. Such energy &amp; such a gentle spirit. 
                I love how he interacts with Annie. He talks to her a lot, pushes 
                her to say what she wants, and acknowledges her strengths &amp; 
                contribution. </font></p>

                hospital. I was scared. It didn't hurt, but just imagine all those 
                people running around frantically just made me think it was serious. 
                And why did they give me water? Did they think I would faint? 
                It was not serious.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">Afterwards I found out my mom thought I 
                was trying to hide the fact I got cut so no one at the meeting 
                would see. What kind of stupid person would hide a cut that was 
                gushing blood? Who does she think I am?</font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">One time I was putting on a helmet in Spain 
                and I was frustrated because it wouldn't fit. I said something 
                to my mom and because of the frustration in my voice she thought 
                I was being mean on purpose (AKA I was trying to make her feel 
                bad)! What have I ever done to make her think I would do something 
                like that? Am I that mean?</font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">I tried to ask her but got no satisfactory 
                answer. Like she was avoiding the question. Am I really that kind 
                of person? I hope not.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#0000FF">This is about our 10th day in this crazy, 
                magical land. We are staying with Suganthi &amp; Poopathi &amp; 
                their family &amp; in the company of Chandra, an Italian weaver 
                who has her hands in everything here, is ingenious at weaving 
                the connections between Italy, Gandhigram &amp; all the social 
                programs here, has a huge heart for the problems, gives much of 
                herself, her energy and her money, and sometimes boggles us with 
                her attempts at organizing everything - including our time here. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">We've thought long about where we should 
                go to spend our 2-3 weeks, have flipped several times between 
                SHARE and here and have finally decided to try to go back to SHARE. 
                The energy is so high and good there &amp; we can complete some 
                of the work we started there. The concept here at Gandhigram is 
                great, but it feels like the have taken on too much. The energy 
                is low and things seem shabby, on the edge. The crafts here don't 
                excite me, the children's home did, but Chandra says they don't 
                want more help now, the building centers seem focused on technologies, 
                not design. The family we've been staying with is great, though 
                and they're hard to leave. But P is now trying to email Murugesan 
                now to see if we can return to SHARE. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">I'm looking forward to going to Madurai 
                tomorrow - a change of pace - see the tourist sights &amp; do 
                some shopping. Staying with an architect, a friend of Chandra. 
                After that, the train back to Vellore, familiar territory. </font></p>

                with Chandra &amp; our host family &amp; Lucian &amp; 3 students 
                at the Natural Dye Center. Was so great to be in the coolness 
                of the mountains, but it didn't feel like India. Many more tourists 
                &amp; much different housing styles. Reminded me much of Riomaggiore 
                when we started out on the paved walk skirting the cliffs to the 
                valley below. Was glad to see this hill station - the tour books 
                talk so much about them. Would have always wondered what we'd 
                missed if we hadn't come here, but know that I don't need to see 
                another one. </font></p>

                schools, orphanage, village workshops, extension programs - moving 
                Gandhi's ideas forward and putting them into practice. We've found 
                in Gandhi's ideas not only the clarity of non-violence that so 
                many people believe needs to be applied in this international 
                sphere but also, the ideas that I've been searching for: an approach 
                to community development in my own home. What Gandhi developed, 
                practiced, refined and lived, as a set of ideas to undertake the 
                equitable development of India as a nation of villages, has struck

              <p><font color="#FF0000">It's good to be &quot;home&quot;, back 
                in the guest room at SHARE. After an over night train from Madurai 
                to Villapuirim, a four hour bus ride and a 20 minute finish in 
                a tuk-tuk, we pulled into SHARE to smiles and greetings from some 
                of the women we'd met last time we were here. It feels like home. 
                In the 11 days since we were here last, we spent a day in Dindigul, 
                5 in Gandhigram, and 4 in Madurai. In these 3 places, we encountered 
                an amazing group of social activities and family members and friends. 
                We've been moving within a web of people loosely tied together 
                by SERVAS and social activism. Tamil culture, it's language, subsistence 
                agricultural village life, music and art, the Hindu religion are 
                a few thousand years old and despite the brutal grip of British 
                colonial rule form the 16th - the mid-20th century, it remains 
                amazingly intact from what we've experienced. Last week, we got 
                the chance to go with Ramalingam to Kalayar Kovil, a town with 
                an amazing Hindu temple and water tank. Unlike most, this tank, 
                a 600 square foot pool is still full of water providing a cooling 
                effect for the area and a wonderful view of the towering temple 
                gate on the other side. With a temple structure in the center, 
                the tank fills with storm water (&quot;3 persons deep&quot;) and 
                slowly percs into the ground recharging the underground water 
                supply. People also use the water, as dozens were that day, to 
                bath and do laundry. A fisherman strung a net across the tank, 
                paying the village for the right to harvest the fish. Goats, pigs, 
                cows and dogs grazed around the edge as Hindu prayer, called Thiruvembai, 
                boomed over the loudspeaker praising the lord Vishnu. The prayer 
                is repeated 100,000 times, which spans three days. This is day 
                one.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Ramalingam is an architect we stayed with 
                in Madurai who's been hired to make some improvements to the area 
                around the tank: pavement to facilitate the annual float festival, 
                public toilets, an entry arch, small drinking water tanks&#133;</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Ramalingam told us a lot about Tamil culture, 
                food, religion, dialing life and we got to see first hand how 
                his architectural practice flows without boundary into his home 
                and family life.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">We also met Ramalingam's father, an amazing 
                man who, at 78 years old, is still a Gandhian activist, reading 
                voraciously and hooking people up to deepen and strengthen people's 
                work. He is also the leader of the Gandhi foundation. Yesterday, 
                a friend of his was in town and stopped by. He is a former Vice 
                Chancellor of the Gandhigram Rural University and now the President 
                of the People's Sarvodaya movement. He invited us to join him 
                on a 6-day walk form village-to-village from the industrial city 
                of Coimbatore to spread Gandhi's message.</font></p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Our perspective may be skewed because of 
                the web we've landed in, but it feels very hopeful here. Clearly, 
                the global culture is making deep inroads and advertising is evident 
                everywhere in Chennai and Madurai (the two major cities we've 
                visited). And from what we've been told, the national leadership 
                of India is anything but Gandhian, exercising corruption, power 
                thirst and military expansion that seem compulsory for world governments 
                today.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">But what is striking is the number of people 
                and organizations engaged in village upliftment, organic farming, 
                rural economic development, empowerment of women and this kind 
                of social work. Rural Universities, Non-Governmental Organizations, 
                and just plain individuals choosing little or no pay to move India 
                toward a positive future. &quot;There's an old, old Tamil work,&quot; 
                said Ramalingam's father, &quot;Sodharma. When you find it, it 
                feeds you. You don't need money.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">This is mind boggling to me, having grown 
                up 100% in the money economy where what you're paid is the measure 
                of your professional success and where such significant financial 
                sacrifice is unheard of. But for south Indians, when you live 
                in a village, your home shelter, you grow food, even cloths is 
                made from cloth woven from thread spun by hand from raw cotton. 
                So there's not much you NEED money for and Indians are masterful 
                at living well and artfully on so little money.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#FF0000">Arranged Marriage<br>
                In this part of India, most marriages are still arranged. In the 
                villages the percentage is higher but even among educated, middle 
                class and city folks, more families still practice arranged marriage 
                as opposed to &quot;love marriages&quot; which are typically seen 
                as outside the family.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Our friend is a 19-year-old pharmacy graduate 
                and daughter of middle class social workers and our SERVAS hosts 
                here. One afternoon, during our visit to their house, while we 
                were checking e-mail with their gifted and enthusiastic 15-year-old 
                son, a family from Chennai was visiting to court the family. This 
                is how an arranged marriage begins, a boys family who'd like to 
                see their son marry a specific girl, visits her family to begin 
                talking. Today, two weeks later, her father is visiting Chennai 
                on a business trip but will also spend 3 or so hours meeting and 
                talking with the young man. All of this is 3 years ahead of the 
                time he expects his daugther to marry and a few months before 
                a decision is made. Her mom already rejected one possible husband 
                because she felt the parents were too selfish and not community 
                oriented enough. But the father is a liberal dad and asked his 
                daughter if she wanted to be involved in the decision. If all 
                of the parents agree that the union should be, the two will meet 
                each other and talk before the wedding, which is still the exception. 
                But she wants to leave the decision to her mom - &quot;she knows 
                better than I do.&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">It's very hard to fit the concept of arranged 
                marriage into the minds of us independent Americans, or ever with 
                the notion of this modern Indian family who spend their days working 
                for an NGO who's mission is the empowerment of women. But since 
                being in India, we've met, observed and talked to a number of 
                people about arranged marriage and it's really an extension of 
                the close-knit, joint-family system. A family's universe tends 
                to be smaller here than in America. Partners, of course, are chosen 
                from among families who are know and so are likely to have similar 
                backgrounds, social status, customs, etc. Choices are made based 
                on preserving and strengthening the family. An architect we met 
                in Madurai, said that he wanted a wife who would want to take 
                care of a large joint family. He was aware of this own ambition 
                to pursue an architecture career, which would limit his time to 
                focus on children and as the oldest son, he felt the responsibility 
                to care for his parents, who they would live with, as they aged. 
                This kind of pragmatic clarity can play a more prominent role 
                in the choice of a partner when our fairy tale notions of &quot;love 
                at first sight&quot; and &quot;happily ever after&quot; are not 
                part of the equation. Clearly, male domination, oppression and 
                even physical abuse can be part of this partnership system but 
                domestic violence is far too prevalent in our system of &quot;free 
                choice, love marriage.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">One day, I walked around the lake in Kodaikanal 
                with our host in Arambathu, outside Gandhigram. He and his wife's 
                marriage was arranged. As we walked, we talked about relationships 
                in the U.S. and India, a tough subject for two with not a lot 
                of shared language, but I got a very clear picture of the love 
                and respect that he says develops in a marriage that starts from 
                nothing and develops over the years into a deep partnership. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">I know for me, I wasted several years several 
                years of my marriage, stagnant in my relationship with Barbara 
                because of my bitterness over the reality that my marriage didn't 
                match the fairy tale happy ever after. I figured I had made a 
                mistake until I finally grew up into the notion of our marriage 
                being a partnership where we got to share life though this partnership 
                continually learning about each other and ourselves. And it's 
                my feeling that most divorces, of which there are so many in America 
                (and very rare in India) happen over the delusion that a fairy 
                tale marriage is the expectation. I do believe that every couple 
                can have a deep soul connection but in many if not most cases, 
                this requires a shedding or cutting thought the preconceptions 
                that we are surrounded with from birth: fairy tales, pop-music, 
                Hollywood, TV, advertising&#133; Lifelong, satisfying and passionate 
                marriage is possible through the sometimes painful, sometimes 
                difficult, hard work and vulnerability.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">From our limited exposure to Indian couples, 
                we saw strong seemingly content and happy women who worked hard 
                but seemed to very prideful and joyful in their role as women 
                in Indian families. Their role is clear. They care for the children, 
                provide wonderful food and clean and artful homes. We've seen 
                many of these same women creating crafts for extra family earnings 
                and organizing Self Help Groups to address important community 
                issues such as access to clean drinking water, sanitation and 
                housing for landless villagers. We've even seen them get help 
                from their husbands around the house (although male roles are 
                another subject). Arranged marriage and powerful womanhood are 
                not incompatible in India.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">This morning we got up at 4:50 am to get 
                ready to go to a wedding. Today is an auspicious day and many 
                weddings will happen throughout Tamil Nadu today. Of course our 
                ride was 45 minutes late and we drove past the wedding hall once, 
                but we got there in time to see some of the ceremony. There were 
                hundreds of people sitting in chairs facing the couple sitting 
                cross-legged on stage surrounded by flowers, burning incense and 
                offerings. Drums and horns kept the rhythm going as a steady stream 
                of guests filed by the couple handing gifts after the religious 
                blessings and offerings had been made. I have to say they looked 
                scared and nervous but who wouldn't under such family/community 
                scrutiny and video cameras. I thought about them never having 
                met before and of course I had no idea what might be going through 
                their minds. I wished them a long and wonderful journey in the 
                midst of such a huge number of family and friends.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#0000FF">A man is walking up the street shouting 
                out something I can't understand. I assume he is selling something 
                as he's repeating the same words over and over as he goes up the 
                street. This morning someone rode by on a bicycle calling out 
                to do repairs. I thought about how great that would be back home. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">It's 2:30 in the afternoon. We're in Thara's 
                house on grass mats on the cement floor. Thara is sleeping, the 
                custom here in village afternoons. P has decided to go with the 
                custom &amp; is sleeping too. AJ is reading &amp; of course, I'm 
                writing. AJ &amp; I are staying here with Thara &amp; her family 
                (2 girls &amp; Thara's mother in the house next door). Santhi's 
                house is in the back with her husband &amp; son. P. is staying 
                a few blocks away in another house - this house is just females, 
                more or less. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Had breakfast this morning with P's family. 
                A man came over to talk &amp; we ended up deep into a discussion 
                of religion &amp; politics. He was strongly Christian &amp; I 
                didn't agree with many things he said, but he made me think. He 
                was pushing P to take responsibility for Bush's actions since 
                he is our president &amp; we have the power of voting. P was saying 
                his usual response that a minority of people voted for Bush &amp; 
                we have the choice of only one of 2 parties with similar agendas 
                so we are really powerless at the presidential level &amp; anyhow, 
                it is all controlled by corporate powers, etc, etc. The guy wasn't 
                buying it - pushing P to take responsibility &amp; pray every 
                night for George W to change - God is powerful enough to change 
                George W. etc., etc. <br>
                Through this all I started thinking that in my worldview what 
                he was saying is that the view P was putting forth (taking no 
                responsibility) was putting no energy toward an alternate vision 
                for change and I realized that I was doing the same. I really 
                believe that intention for change supports change to happen; and 
                that if we feel powerless in a situation and focus no energy toward 
                its change, then we are no more useful than those who support 
                the situation. Like the hundredth monkey, the last straw, it all 
                adds up, and we haven't been using this power that we have to 
                envision a change. So we're in effect withholding our individual 
                energy from the world's energy. And it's all because our thoughts 
                are directed negatively toward what we don't like rather than 
                positively toward what we want. We've given up and that ensures 
                the status quo. </font></p>

                it explains to an extreme extent. So it is way too easy but I

                the way I feel about leaving my parents. Last night, I did a sleep 
                over with (the girls). Then I was supposed to go to school with 
                them but it wasn't possible. I was actually kind-of glad I had 
                to go home. I wanted to spend time with my mom and dad. Not that

              <p><font color="#0000FF">Morning in the village. <br>
                Many morning rituals here for the women (I don't know the men's 
                rituals if there are any.). Floors of houses &amp; streets are 
                swept every morning. Then water splashed on the dirt floor outside 
                the doorway &amp; a decorative kolam (chalk drawing) made in the 
                dirt. Theoretically this should all happen before 6:30. Water 
                starts flowing at the faucets on the street for a half hour at 
                about 7:00 - women wait their turn at the faucet nearest their 
                house - bright colorful plastic containers, shiny brass and stainless 
                steel. Back &amp; forth with the containers from house to faucet, 
                house to faucet, talking, laughing, street gutters running free 
                with water, their daily cleansing. Street vendors on bicycles 
                ride by hawking their wares - tomatoes, eggplants, flowers, milk. 
                Weights &amp; balances hang from handle bars. Tea is prepared 
                &amp; served, idley cooked. Dogs play in the street, shy children 
                hide in their mother's skirts, chickens peck at crumbs in the 
                road, old women brush their teeth &amp; spit in the gutter (usually 
                using toothpaste, but this morning I saw a poor woman crumble 
                up parts of a brick, rub her finger in it then over her teeth 
                to clean them), roosters crow, music drifts in from the next street, 
                neighbors chat, bicycles pass by overloaded with palm leaves, 
                motorcycles leave for the work day, the sun creeps slowly up the 
                sky. I have tried to capture it in photos, but as usual one piece 
                at a time, it doesn't add up to the whole. </font></p>

              <p><font color="#0000FF">Surely if Turkey was less exotic than I 
                expected, India has been more so, though not in the ways I would 
                have predicted. I had met so many people from India in the States 
                before coming that I thought it would feel familiar, but the country 
                has surprised me, possibly more than any other. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Last year on Mt. Rainier, I was surprised 
                to see Indian women, playing in the snow fields in bright colored 
                saris &amp; new running shoes. It was such strange dress for the 
                snow that I thought they were probably an unusual orthodox sect 
                of India, bound to a dress style by religious order. Here in Tamil 
                Nadu, I see that this is just the everyday dress of all the married 
                women, that's all they have, tropical climate or snow field, just 
                the way they dress. I am weird to them in my western dresses (have 
                not even tried to wear pants here). The saris are, of course, 
                beautiful and simple. The color of the saris with their exquisite 
                gold borders is for me the image of this country. My photographer's 
                eye seeks them out as I frame each photo. And I now have my share 
                of saris (3 of them). But I haven't gotten comfortable in one 
                yet, which is probably part of my fascination with them. So often 
                they get in the way with their folds of cloth. I can't walk fast, 
                certainly can't run. My legs get sticky with sweat &amp; the fabric 
                wraps around them so I can barely move. I get irritated and jerk 
                it loose, yearn for the freedom of pants. The blouses are very 
                tight, especially around the upper arms. When I pointed this out 
                to the tailor, thinking she had made mine too small, she laughed 
                at my loose American T-shirt style. As for my breasts, well, somehow 
                they were squished in with much pushing. So, beautiful as they 
                are, I would rather wear the churidar (sp?) here (calf length 
                dress with pants underneath), or a half sari (long skirt and blouse 
                with a short sari shawl over the shoulder). But both these are 
                reserved for the unmarried young women and they will have none 
                of that for me. (Unfortunately, I found this out only after I 
                had bought a churidar.) My western dress they tolerate reluctantly 
                on the occasions that I wear it (I don't yet know if they're disappointed 
                by it, or if it is offensive to them - we're not up to that subtlety 
                of communication yet.) I like that they don't envy my western 
                dress, even disparage it. I like this strength of their culture. 
                But my American individualism, rebels somewhat at the restrictions 
                imposed on me. I often disappoint them - from my lack of gold 
                jewelry to my short (relatively) hair &amp; bangs. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Because of the saris, the women move always 
                through the world with grace and beauty (I don't know how they 
                do it). Even doing road construction, passing pans of concrete 
                down a construction line, their beautiful saris sway with each 
                movement. I can see they have none of my awkwardness with its 
                length &amp; folds of cloth. I love to dress up in one for an 
                occasion (feeling elegant), but rush home quickly to change&amp; 
                relax afterward, disappointing them again immensely. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">The men have two options - pants &amp; 
                shirt (similar to western style, though shirt never tucked in) 
                and dhoti (a rectangle of cloth wrapped around the waist like 
                we might wrap a towel, though longer, to the ankles.) This can 
                be folded up to shorts length when desired (tho' P once did this 
                &amp; was told to pull it down - we still don't know why). It 
                too has its awkwardness at first that men here have mastered, 
                so that it never falls off or shows their underwear. P has left 
                for the peace walk with just his dhoti &amp; I assume he will 
                return comfortable in it. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Annie is accepted well - western dress, 
                or half sari. They love the anklets she has purchased &amp; it 
                delights her. Her biggest struggle is copious mosquito bites. 
                She gets comments and concerns all the time and is the center 
                of many discussions that go on at length. I know she hates this 
                attention to her skin and am amazed at how she holds up each time. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">The other thing that bothers most Indian 
                women about me is that I have no outward symbol of being married. 
                This is very curious to them and is almost always commented upon. 
                I have thought perhaps it's offensive &amp; P &amp; I talked about 
                getting rings while on this trip, but have not taken the time 
                yet. So I often find myself explaining my lack of marriage jewelry. 
                Women here have several symbols - a gold rope or chain worn around 
                the neck with gold &quot;charms&quot; on it - one of them given 
                by the husband at marriage &amp; others by the family. These are 
                all pure gold, except for the chain, which is frequently just 
                a cord for poorer women. They also wear silver rings on their 
                second toes and some of them a stripe of red chalk down the part 
                of their hairline. I, having none of these, (except sometimes 
                the red chalk which is easily applied) am a curiosity to all &amp; 
                many conversations center on this. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">So maybe this leads us to arranged marriage, 
                which is also one of the topics on my list. For me, this is probably 
                one of the biggest cultural differences, as I realize its impact 
                on the teenage &amp; early 20's years that so many of us westerners 
                look back on with so much nostalgia and sometimes horror. Courting/dating 
                seems nonexistent here. Almost all marriages are arranged, the 
                couples frequently don't know each other when arrangements are 
                made &amp; usually don't spend time together (certainly not alone) 
                until after the wedding day. I can't begin to imagine how these 
                young couples feel after the wedding. The shock &amp; awkwardness 
                that we might imagine as westerners is possibly very misleading 
                for this different culture. The people we've talked to about this 
                first time of being together acknowledged it as somewhat awkward 
                &amp; said they talked mostly about practical things - how they 
                would live together, etc. Sex &#133; we haven't even tried to 
                discuss how that progresses with two people who have just found 
                themselves married. Perhaps it just happens without all the hoopla 
                that we westerners throw on it. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Indian culture seems to have none of the 
                preoccupation with dating that so defines our early western lives 
                - it just doesn't exist. There is a depth in this difference that 
                I know I can't quite understand, not having experienced it. There 
                is a freedom in their way, a release from all the narcissism &amp; 
                self-preoccupation that dating brings &amp; couples here seem 
                content. Divorce is infrequent (also not socially condoned). There 
                is much family support to help couples through difficult times. 
                In all, getting married is a big deal, but afterwards, the marriage 
                itself seems much less of a focus than in the west. So though 
                couples seem more content than us, they rarely seem joyous (or 
                furious) with each other. And that perhaps is the flip side of 
                what we get with our narcissism. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">There is also the western ideal of building 
                something together, making some statement as a couple that seems 
                to be absent here. Couples build families together &amp; one person 
                in the couple often supports the work of the other (usually it's 
                the woman who supports the man, but sometimes it's the man, as 
                in the case of Mani supporting Rani), but the support person is 
                in the shadows in all the relationships I've seen. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Sometimes marriages are arranged as early 
                as 13 years (Rani married at 13). But most marriages here are 
                arranged when the young woman is 20 or 21 and the young man 25-30. 
                &quot;Love marriages&quot; (or &quot;unarranged&quot; marriages) 
                are not common. Sometimes the term &quot;love marriage&quot; is 
                reserved for marriages that don't have the parent's consent. More 
                often it's used for marriages where the couple has selected each 
                other. Marriage without the parents' consent is very sad in this 
                culture &amp; usually the couple is disowned by the families (&amp; 
                gets no dowry from the bride's family). </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Arranging a marriage is done by the parents. 
                Frequently marriages are arranged with relatives, &amp; often 
                the person is known &amp; from the same village (though since 
                the boy is older, he usually isn't a close friend). In most cases 
                the boy &amp; girl get to accept/reject the choice. Most young 
                people I have talked to respect their parents' judgment. I've 
                asked only a few women, but they've all said they'd rather their 
                parents make this important decision for them because they have 
                more experience in life. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Two things in our western culture - our 
                rebellion from our parents/elders &amp; our individuality make 
                this hard for us to understand. There is still much respect for 
                elders here, including parents. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Our individuality is a more interesting 
                thing. Keep in mind here that the object is to get everyone married. 
                Some are obviously easier to arrange than others, but it seems 
                that matches are made for most. It's acknowledged that if a girl/woman 
                gets too old, say over 30, it will be hard to find a match. And 
                once someone told me that she got an &quot;old husband&quot; because 
                of some problem with making a match (I can't remember what). But 
                everyone gets married more or less. Now, my western mind says 
                &quot;But what about the really disagreeable people?&quot; And 
                as I look across the people we've come in contact with here in 
                India, it seems tat people are generally more agreeable. That 
                may be a naive observation from an outsider. But it seems like 
                the excesses of western culture also allow excesses of personality. 
                There is certainly a narrower range of acceptable behavior &amp; 
                the closeness of families/villages exerts its control also. I 
                wonder if the family support network is so strong here that it 
                keeps people from getting so desperate &amp; antisocial. At any 
                rate, they may be hidden, but the extremes of personality seem 
                less here than in the US. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Now what about someone who doesn't want 
                to get married? Haven't heard that one here - though I think there 
                are some religious options. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">One other thing I wanted to remember about 
                arranged marriages is that it's very important for the astrological 
                signs to be compatible - matches can be called off if signs are 
                not compatible and it can be very difficult to arrange a marriage 
                for an orphan who doesn't know their birth date. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Sanitation and the floor:<br>
                Gandhi lamented the lack of cleanliness of the average Indian. 
                And in all the houses we have stayed in, I have longed to do just 
                one good day of cleaning, to feel joy in the place from a very 
                western bias. But the thing that would have shocked my mother 
                most is the use of the floor. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Now, life in India is basically a life 
                on the floor. To appreciate the use of the floor, you have to 
                understand that the floor is the primary surface here - most work 
                (including kitchen work) is done on the floor, meals are eaten 
                there, homework is done there and sleeping too. Most South Indian 
                houses have little furniture - usually only a table/stand for 
                the TV (if there is one), a chair for guests, and maybe a bed 
                (though I've never seen anyone sleep in one). Oh, yes, sometimes 
                there is one standing cabinet, like a wardrobe, and recessed niches 
                of shelving in the walls. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">All cooking prep is done on the floor usually 
                in the main living area. Chopping is done with a stationary blade 
                on a stand that is wedged under your legs. The veggies are moved 
                across this blade (as opposed to the western style of a moving 
                blade and stationary vegetable). Grinding, like for chutney, is 
                done by rotating a large grinding stone in a hole in the concrete 
                floor, usually off to one corner (It's washing becomes part of 
                the floor's washing). Cooking tho' is done standing up at a ledge 
                with gas burners on it or on an outside wood/dung fire. Eating 
                &amp; sleeping happen on this same floor, marked by the comings 
                &amp; goings of dishes &amp; thin woven grass sleep mats, respectively. 
                The bathing, laundry area may be an uncurtained alcove off the 
                cooking area, sharing a common set of water jugs for all the washing 
                needs (body, clothes, dishes). Peeing also happens here - convenient 
                indoor space, though there's also a general-purpose toilet outside 
                in the outhouse. Haven't quite gotten used to peeing in this wash 
                area, basically a corner of the kitchen. I have recollections 
                of Carl W. telling me that pee is sterile, but my western being 
                cringes. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#0000FF">Outside toilets - basically outhouses - 
                in private homes are quite reasonable. Must get used to the eastern 
                style toilet in the floor and a pitcher of water to wipe your 
                butt (no toilet paper), but I seem to have mastered both at this 
                point in the trip. </font></p>

              <p><font color="#FF0000">I kept notes yesterday of all the places 
                we stopped and some anecdotes of each one: missed connections, 
                closed offices, plans fallen through&#133; Partly, I did this 
                to remember and be able to match up the photos we took. Party, 
                I did it in a mocking spirit, noticing the lack of planning and 
                communication in preparation for this journey. This is one of 
                my strategies for feeling superior. My ego. Not able to speak 
                the language, I'm missing a lot of the details so I fill in the 
                blanks with my imagination. I figure out who I'm smarter than 
                or better than, I &quot;write off&quot; people from the &quot;competition&quot; 
                when I declare they're not in the running.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Last night, I got to know better, two of 
                the men I'd written off. They've taken on more of a support role 
                in the walk. They're quieter, they speak less English. I'm learning, 
                slowly, that there's at least a physical, intellectual, emotional, 
                and spiritual plane - me spending most of my time in the intellectual 
                first (always thinking, putting ideas together, imagining how 
                I would do things), and second on the physical and emotional plane. 
                I'm in good physical condition, I eat well, and I'm strong and 
                relatively flexible. I say that &quot;I do yoga&quot; although 
                that means 20 minutes a day, tending toward 10-15 and not often 
                at all on the trip. Last night, I was speaking to one of the men, 
                Senthamizh, about his lifestyle (although he didn't call it that). 
                I was humbled to find out that he is 65 years old, that he sleeps 
                two hours a night and does two hours of yoga, meditation and prayer 
                each morning. He takes no medication. I notice now, that the calmness 
                with which he approaches all of his actions is because of this 
                and I marvel at the connection between this physical and spiritual 
                plane - the physical that I only dabble in and the spiritual where 
                I spend very little conscious time.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Our host saw me journaling this morning 
                and said, &quot;oh, a diary. Sir, is it a spiritual diary or a 
                mundane diary?&quot; Dr. Markendan asked me about being a Christian 
                and I explained that I was a Jew. &quot;how do you pray?&quot; 
                he asked. I skirted around the question.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">I've come on this walk attracted to Gandhi 
                on the intellectual plane: What can I learn from his teachings 
                to strengthen my community-building work. Elements of his teaching 
                that I've skimmed over speak of the deep spirituality of service 
                to others, to community and to a spiritual path and I feel as 
                though I'm looking into an infinitely deep well.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">This is only the third day of this walk 
                beginning now. I'm feeling humble and a little scared. The spiritual 
                plane has always scared me. I feel ill-equipped and out of my 
                element. Senthamizh said that he would guide me in his yoga practice 
                for which we have three days. I'm excited about the idea of diving 
                into the spiritual through the physical side - yoga, breathing&#133;and 
                I'm looking forward more openly to what might come to us on today's 
                journey.</font></p>

                make a good friend in 3-4 days (in a different language) but it's 
                very difficult to make friends knowing you will leave in a few 
                days and maybe never see them again. It almost makes me not want

                as an architect and working in my community in Seattle Washington

                and equality.</font></p>

                Europe. There are also East Indians in my community as well as 
                Native Americans.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">My wife and I are taking a one-year trip 
                around the world spending one month in each of 10 countries. After 
                seven months, we are here in India. What I've discovered here 
                is that America and India are polar opposites. America has material 
                wealth but tremendous cultural and spiritual poverty. India, on 
                the other hand, has material poverty but tremendous cultural and 
                spiritual wealth. Thousands of years of cultural practice that 
                gave the world Hinduism, Buddhism, the Gita, yoga, and Mahatma 
                Gandhi to name just a few things. These traditions all value community 
                harmony, cultural and spiritual practice and respect for nature. 
                India may be the only place in the world with true religious tolerance 
                and cooperation. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">America is undisputedly a developed country 
                while India has been called a developing country or a 3rd world 
                country. But the real question is: what is development? </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">While I love my country, I'm sad to say 
                that we are leading the world down the wrong development path: 
                toward individualism, materialism, globalization, ecological destruction 
                and frivolous lifestyles. We've lost our sense of community and 
                many of our families have disintegrated. Divorce, alcohol and 
                drug abuse, domestic violence and crime are all far too common 
                in the U.S.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">While I've seen and heard that these trends 
                have taken hold in India, through my eyes, Indian culture in Tamil 
                Nadu is so strong. In towns and villages, even in cities, I've 
                seen daily spiritual practices, strong families, and thriving 
                communities. I've met social workers, NGO's hundreds of women 
                in self-help groups, Khadi manufacturers, organic farmers, all 
                creating an alternative development path, bringing greater health 
                and economic self-sufficiency to many rural people without destroying 
                Indian culture. This was Gandhi's dream.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">While the East India Company and the British 
                Empire worked directly and often brutally to dismantle Indian 
                culture and extract its wealth, they didn't succeed. But today's 
                enemy is much more deceptive. It comes through your TV sets, magazines 
                and newspapers, pop music and film. Global culture, which promotes 
                endless consumption, is a lie that results in profits for the 
                stockholders and executives of multi-national corporations and 
                kills culture and the environment in its path.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The lie is this: &quot;If you buy these 
                products, you will be happy. You will have fun. You will be rich, 
                powerful and sexy.&quot; And people all over the world are being 
                swept up by it, especially our kids.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">O.K. I'm guessing that none of this is 
                new to you. Still, what must we do together? First of all, I pledge 
                to you that on my return to America, I will continue to organize 
                American people around Gandhi's principles and work against my 
                government's destructive path of globalization. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Second , I want to humbly offer you three 
                suggestions:</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">1. Study Gandhi. Not just non-violence. 
                Not just his program for village upliftment, but most importantly, 
                the path to personal fulfillment: the spiritual path. Indian people 
                know this well.<br>
                2. Oppose Globalization. Free Trade means the oppression of poor 
                people and environmental destruction. Don't' let multinational 
                corporations set your government's agenda or take a stronger hold 
                in India. Opposing globalization also means you must stop buying 
                their products. Pepsi, coke, Levis, Nike, Reebok&#133; Generally, 
                these products have less nutritional value, workers are exploited 
                in their production and profits leave India for wealthy corporate 
                stockholders.<br>
                3. Turn off your TV. Many television shows brainwash us and especially 
                our children. Advertising leads us to dislike our lives and ourselves 
                so that we feel we need products to be happy. And TV creates the 
                worship of professional athletes and movie stars so that we will 
                wish to be like them. Just as important, when the TV is off, families, 
                children and communities are together interacting with each other 
                and strengthening each other.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Just three suggestions. I know this is 
                difficult. But if it's possible anywhere in the world, it's possible 
                in India. You already have Gandhiji in your blood and the People's 
                Sarvodaya movement and so many other Gandhian organizations. You 
                already have small-scale agriculture and village-based industries. 
                You already have strong community life and religious practice. 
                From my experience as well, practicing these three suggestions 
                is not actually a sacrifice but leads to a richer and more fulfilling 
                life.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">In closing, I wish you luck on this journey 
                together. I also want to thank all of the people I've met in Tamil 
                Nadu for teaching me so much and for giving my family and I so 
                many gifts of food, a place to sleep, friendship and for sharing 
                with us, your beautiful culture. Thank you.</font></p>

                (Paul)</font></b></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Sitting on the train, on the hard seat 
                for the past four hours, simultaneously sweating and drying in 
                the air rushing passed the open window, the Indian countryside 
                flying by with coconut palms, sugar cane, recently plowed or planted 
                fields and clusters of houses, my mind has wondered around Indian 
                culture. I've sat with 4 generations of village men and boys in 
                the shade of a Hindu temple, I've seen groups of women in multi-colored 
                saris carrying water from a nearby well; I've been with half the 
                village attending a ritual ceremony at one of the many local temples, 
                children chasing each other as the drums and music pulse; I've 
                watched pairs of bullocks, slowly, methodically pulling carts 
                of goods along the roads with speeding motor bikes carrying whole 
                families; and I've eaten plentiful, healthy, hand-crafted South 
                Indian vegetarian food. And I've wished we had such sights at 
                home.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">But many people here are unemployed or 
                are scratching out a living in the dry land of recent water shortages. 
                Strong cultures also allow far more limited choices, so it's difficult 
                for them to adapt to the rapidly changing backdrops of climate 
                and commercial/cultural globalization. The changes taking place 
                are dramatic and may be difficult to incorporate here in rural 
                India.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">I've been traveling with a small group 
                of Gandhians talking about how people should use Gandhi's teachings 
                to improve village life. My adopted role has been to try and blunt 
                the allure of American culture. I've talked about the military 
                machine, our daily fear of crime, the disintegration of American 
                families, the over-consumption of precious resources and the emptiness 
                of pop-culture. I truly believe that the prevailing culture in 
                American has no soul. With our individualism, our extreme mobility 
                and our lack of strong cultural or religious traditions, we've 
                allowed ourselves to trivialize everything and accept, or at least 
                live with, the sickening, profane and insulting images that advertising 
                and mass media give us. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">But because of how far and how fast our 
                culture has gone in this direction, many people have woken up. 
                Smart, brave and committed people have done thousands of experiments 
                to create alternatives to prevailing American culture. Farmers, 
                business people, teachers, social workers, planners, spiritual 
                leaders, counselors&#133; have poured their hearts and souls into 
                looking for and creating solutions. Out of this ground, broken 
                and fertilized by these pioneers, a brand new culture has risen. 
                It doesn't even span a generation, this new culture, and it may 
                be extremely fragile, but it has a clear set of principles at 
                it's heart and is practiced, against odds, by millions of people 
                around the U.S. as well as perhaps in every country on the globe. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The counter-culture of the late '60's and 
                '70's was a necessary and refreshing reaction to how far down 
                the wrong path America had gone but it was a counter culture: 
                a reactive movement and thereby, bound to be short-lived. While 
                many people gave it up when the point was made or when they ran 
                out of money and needed to go back to work, others turned their 
                creative attention toward rather than their reactive attention 
                against. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The next wave was characterized by struggle 
                and hard work by scores of people laying the foundation for the 
                new culture. This group also needed to come to terms still with 
                the reactivity of the counter-culture movement, so in addition 
                to the struggle, deep soul-searching was required and burn out 
                was often the result. This period lasted most of the rest of the 
                20th century.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">The result is that we now have a new culture 
                that is recognizable. Although more refinement is certainly necessary, 
                a large enough body of work (teachers, books, institutions, living 
                examples) exists in real time and place. The new culture is based 
                on the principles of consciousness, relationships, personal growth, 
                living lightly on the earth, and equal rights and justice for 
                all people and all cultures.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Having come into adulthood in the 1980's, 
                I have been fortunate enough to be involved in some of the experiments 
                of the late 20th century. Living this way for most of the past 
                decade has awakened deep feelings in me as it has in many others 
                in the new culture and it is deeply fulfilling. I've come to realize 
                that my life is whole. The alienation that I've felt from my culture, 
                the confusion about how to live &quot;right&quot; in this fractured 
                country, and the desperation about whether we might ever turn 
                around the destruction, are gone. I still have questions. Each 
                day is still filled with compromises of my core values because 
                the larger society doesn't share my culture. And I have grave 
                doubts about the planet being able to hold up under the stress 
                we are collectively placing on it. But my general feeling is internal 
                peace. I love my life and I love my culture.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">This contentment is not ignorance or complacency. 
                I still feel a strong responsibility to work for justice and equity, 
                to strengthen organizations that do this work and to continue 
                to learn, grow and improve myself.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">This contentment is my strongest evidence 
                that the new culture exists. Traveling around the world, I've 
                marveled at this contentment that I've seen in people whose lives 
                are internally and externally consistent. They feel content because 
                they are practicing cultures that are generations, if not millennia 
                old. Their houses, their food, their clothing, their religions, 
                their daily lives, have been developed in tune with their environment, 
                they are graceful and make sense in every way except when measured 
                against the narrow ruler of material wealth held out by global 
                pop-culture. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FF0000">Only after leaving my home, my culture, 
                my friends and my daily life has it been possible for me to see 
                this contentment in others and to look inside to find it also 
                in myself.</font></p>
              <p><b><font color="#006600">Monday, March 17th - Edayansathu (Annie)</font></b></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">At the age of four or so, I used to wake 
                up around 5-6 am every morning, when the sun rose in my face and 
                sneak about the house doing all sorts of things like etch-a-sketch, 
                stamps, paper cutting&#133;I've always loved edible plants and 
                believed luck dwelled in the natural world. So if you sat long 
                enough in the clover patch feeling the leaves, you would be more 
                lucky to win at cards. In my unconscious choice of who to go see 
                I tend to wander towards those younger than me and find joy in 
                simple &quot;childish&quot; games like tag, duck duck goose or 
                jump rope. I have difficulty having fun for my striving to be 
                &quot;cool&quot; so I can have friends. I have laid off those 
                practices, which interested me so. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">I have never quite been understood. And 
                never quite understood anyone. The truth is, I have never really 
                felt I belonged. I feel as if I know a lot more than I could ever 
                say. And I have weird notions of things that when I tell people, 
                they never quite get the significance of. India struck back at 
                the British who were enslaving their people and ruling their country 
                on September 11! It seems so obvious that the war that followed 
                would repeat in modern times but &quot;it's irrelevant, just a 
                coincidence.&quot; Is it? Sometimes I see things, the answer to 
                a question on the paper Rod is looking at written clearly in my 
                mind almost as if I'm looking through his eyes! I am always drawn 
                to folklore fairy tales. I feel as if I belong there.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">Strange words pop into my head almost like 
                I'm remembering them. In Pakistan, I wanted a silver anklet and 
                it seemed perfectly natural that one month later I found almost 
                everyone in India had one. Some would call it creepy. I don't 
                find anything weird about it. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600"><b>Tuesday, March 18th - Edayansathu (Annie)</b></font></p>
              <p><font color="#006600">I have concluded that I am neither a cat 
                nor an otter at heart but that I am an Indian girl. I have never 
                felt such an attachment to my place before. And now we have to 
                leave 9. I have made such good friends and learned so much. I 
                have concluded that if I am who I want to be, why not be myself?</font></p>

    <p>Before entering Masai Mara reserve, a huge wildlife refuge that straddles 
      Kenya and Tanzania and encompasses the Great Rift Valley and the Serengeti 
      Plain, our group had a brief stop at a Masai village. It was a strange combination 
      of living their traditional life and accommodating tourists. Many Masai 
      people still live in many small villages (this one had 82 people). With 
      the creation of the park, much of the land the Masai used for grazing and 
      building villages (they are nomadic and move every 6-8 years) was locked 
      up. That and the influence of the tourist economy are bringing considerable 
      change to the Masai people.</p>

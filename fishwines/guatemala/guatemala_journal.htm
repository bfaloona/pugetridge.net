        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">It’s 
          really cold here in Todos Santos but we’ve got this really cushy room.  
          Tile floor, nice beds, <span
class=GramE>a</span> small table with 2 chairs.  It’s really wild though.  Outside 
          our door is another world.  Todos Santos is an overgrown 3<sup>rd</sup> 
          world village.  There’s this main street exactly 2 busses wide between 
          sidewalks, add 5 feet total for the sidewalks on each side to the face 
          of the buildings.  We arrived today at about </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="16">4 pm</st1:time>.  Market day was over but there were still 
          lots of people.  <span class=GramE>Lots of people.</span>  2 other busses 
          arrived within 10 minutes of ours – Todosanteros getting on and off 
          the busses plus the usual shops and street vendors.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">The 
          last hour of this bus ride through very steep, gorgeous farmland/mountains, 
          was on a dirt road – very bumpy, muddy (it was raining – no windshield 
          wipers) and very scary.  Major drop off!  We’d seen signs elsewhere 
          in </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Guatemala</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
          that said “Peligroso” (dangerous) but they didn’t even bother with this 
          road that dead-ends in Todos Santos.  It’s the most remote place that 
          I’ve ever been.  <span
class=GramE>Remote in the sense of what it takes physically to get here.</span>  
          The Internet hasn’t reached here yet but there are a few cars and pick-ups, 
          electricity (which also means music and TV) and other signs of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
          century.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">But 
          Todos Santos is clearly very poor.  Most people here are Mayans and 
          wear typical clothes unique to this village.  <span class=GramE>The 
          women - deep blue skirts and colorful shirts, the men - red striped 
          pants and denim-like shirts with wide colorful collars.</span>  Many 
          also wear small-brimmed straw hats with Mayan color bands but many have 
          traded them in for baseball-type caps (SF 49ers, Nike…).  Even children 
          and teens dress this way and age doesn’t seem to be the factor of why 
          people choose which type of hat.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">What 
          makes this community hang on to this tradition?  Do they talk about 
          it?  I’d love to find out.  And what’s the relationship between the 
          uniformity of dress and the sense of community?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>Back in Huehuetenango you can see the Todosanteros around and know where 
          they’re from – other village dress being different.</span></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">This 
          morning in Huehue, we gave Maria a “tip” which really touched her (she’s 
          a Mayan <span class=GramE>women</span> – housekeeper/cook for the Ladino 
          Gonzales family – Servas Hosts we stayed with) and walked around town 
          trying to find the Internet café Annie and I were at yesterday.  We 
          gave up and found another.  Barbara was typing away while Annie and 
          I sat on a bench in the lobby.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">I 
          looked over at Annie and noticed she was looking sad.  After a few wrong 
          guesses on my part as to why and a little coaxing, Annie told me that 
          every time she tried to start a conversation I ignored her, didn’t laugh 
          at her jokes, etc.  “I’m sorry Annie, you’re right.  I’m feeling kind 
          of nervous about being here and haven’t gotten used to traveling yet.  
          I’m worried about speaking Spanish and thinking that I should be asking 
          directions about the bus today.  Thanks for point it out to me kiddo, 
          I’ll try to do better.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">The 
          fact is<span class=GramE>,</span> there’s something going on with me 
          about feeling out of place: feeling like I don’t belong here and wondering 
          how a whole year of this is going to feel.  Walking up to people and 
          speaking Spanish is a challenge for me.  I’m taking it on pretty well 
          but it really puts me up against that feeling of being out of place 
          – an “invasive species.”</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">Maybe 
          there’s a connection between these feelings and the benefits of all 
          of “one’s people” wearing “red pants”.  Maybe it’s one of the reasons 
          that there are fashion trends.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">With 
          our packs on, wandering around El Centro of Huehuetenango, we got as 
          many answers to our quest for bus directions as people we asked.  All 
          at once, a bus was pulling up to the corner on which we were standing 
          that was headed for the bus terminal.  We scrambled up the ladder with 
          our packs on and into the emergency exit at the back of this converted 
          school bus.  There was plenty of room.  Annie initiated a game of hand 
          slapping – her reminder to me earlier about being present helped me 
          as we amused several of our Guatemalans fellow bus riders with our game.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">In 
          typical fashion so far on this trip, our switch to the Todos Santos 
          bus was totally smooth and off we went.  <span
class=GramE>As the ride went on, the bus become more and more empty until there 
          were only about 10 of us getting off in El Centro de Todos </span></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=GramE>Santos</span></st1:place></st1:City><span class=GramE>.We even managed 
          to get set up with our host family and our cushy room.</span>  Once 
          off the bus, we greeted by a couple of boys asking if we wanted a hotel.  
          They seemed about 7 years old (later found out that they were 11!).  
          There are three language schools in Todos Santos and we didn’t know 
          which one we were in.  We only knew that the director’s name was Nicole.  
          The kids seemed very confident that they knew Nicole and which school 
          this was so we followed them back across town to Proyecto Linguistico.  
          The director was not in town but after a pretty short wait and some 
          soup across the street, Margarito, one of the instructors set up with 
          Flori, our host.  Orientation tomorrow (Sunday) and Spanish language 
          school starts Monday at <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="14">2 pm</st1:time>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">Our 
          host family is huge – grandma, several of her sons and daughters and 
          their kids.  One of the daughters is 13.  She works at home in the mornings 
          and goes to school from 2-6:30.  I asked if Annie could come with her 
          to school sometime and she said yes.  Annie said she’d like to but not 
          right away.  She wants to get to know her a bit first.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">This 
          house is a crazy labyrinth of habitable, barely habitable and uninhabited 
          spaces that I haven’t figured out yet.  I’m really looking forward to 
          getting to know our family and instructors and getting a feel for the 
          life in this overgrown village.</font></p>

          much Spanish packed into this brain!  <span class=GramE>The first day 
          of classes de Espanol – 5 hours, one-on-one.</span>  At the end, we 
          covered “Cuanto Cuesta?” – <span class=GramE>how</span> much does it 
          cost?  Jorge asked me “Cuanto Cuesta una taza de café?”  (<span class=GramE>a</span> 
          cup of coffee).  I said </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:City> 
          is famous for special coffee and people can easily spend $3 on a cup 
          of coffee.  <span class=GramE>Then $200 for a fancy hotel room.</span>  
          <span
class=GramE>The I</span> asked, “Cuanto gana un maestro de esta escuela?”  How 
          much does a teacher at this school earn?  Then we were comparing the 
          cost and standard of living of our two countries.  It was the end of 
          the lesson but the most interesting part for me.  Jorge stopped being 
          the teacher and we were engaged in our exploration.  We ended with a 
          shared understanding that there’s really no difference in “what it takes” 
          to live and that the money part is not important.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">This 
          morning before lunch, I spent 3 hours on a construction site with Elbi, 
          the brother of our host Flori, who is building a big house a few doors 
          down.  <span class=GramE>Many differences from job sites at home.</span>  
          There were piles of sand and gravel, scrap wood and concrete block, 
          puddles of water with rebar and other scraps floating.  One difference 
          <span class=GramE>was,</span> that there were 3 or 4 kids playing in 
          the puddles while we worked.  Ages 2 ½ to 10.  Elbi and 2 masons were 
          up on top of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor just hanging out, looking down.  
          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City> 
          and I had stopped sifting sand from the gravel pile and were also just 
          standing there.  Elbi yelled down to ask the kids how deep the water 
          was.  <st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City> had picked 
          up Maria, the 2-½ year old and was saying, “<span class=GramE>look</span> 
          up at your Poppy up there!”  Elbi tossed down some bills and told <st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City> 
          to take Maria around the corner to buy her some boots so she could play 
          in the puddle too.  Off we went, <st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City> 
          and I, each of us holding one of her hands – an important part of building 
          this house!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">About 
          15 minutes after we returned, <span class=GramE>pan y frescos (bread 
          and soda) was</span> purchased for the crew and we took a “break”.  
          Maria sat in Elbi’s lap and he re-did the barrette in her hair.  At 
          another point, a friend stopped by.  <span class=GramE>He as drunk, 
          wearing typical Todos Santos clothes with an “NHL” patch on the arm.</span>  
          He spoke some English and was clearly bothered by me but was playing 
          around.  He brought Elbi and I a beer and told us to drink (we did) 
          and told me the fucking tourists run the Guatemalan economy.  With a 
          wink from Elbi and </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City>, 
          I figured things could get weird if I didn’t drink the beer and keep 
          nodding my head.  Eventually he left.  Mothers came for their <span class=GramE>children,</span> 
          other kids came and played with the sand as we were sifting, etc.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">I 
          don’t know how much block was laid, but in 3 hours, we had managed to 
          mix a few yards of cement, sift a few wheelbarrows of sand, and give 
          several kids some loving adult attention.  As far as I could tell this 
          was the standard for industrial production here.</font></p>

          I liked how they treated me, the other workers, the kids, and the house 
          they were building.  None seemed more important than the other.  I have 
          no idea about the economics of this venture, so it’s tough to see the 
          whole picture but assuming it’s at least marginally harmonious, I really

          Dozens of Todosanteros line the <span class=GramE>street,</span> buy 
          coffee standing, while the “Perro callejeros” (street dogs) fight for 
          scraps.  The bus “captain” is unloading firewood and other baggage from 
          the top of the bus and loading it again while people board.  All of 
          this in time with the slow drone of the musica blaring from the Iglesia

          cobblestone main street is the repository of everything here in Todos

          wash water, kid’s laughter, men’s pee, market transactions, drunken 
          men sleeping off the trespasses of the previous night, Mayan women walking 
          with baskets of squash and other fruits of their labor, babies strapped

          leaving Todos Santos are virtually empty while those arriving are packed, 
          three to a seat and standing the aisles.  The busses have names here, 
          like “Flor de Maria”.  They’re not just machines, but trusted companions 
          over the remote and often dangerously steep mountain roads.  The sky 
          is now bright enough to have turned off the streetlights.  There’s now 
          other music competing with the church as trucks unload more goods for 
          the market.  Strolling through the church plaza and the main market 
          street, my throat is pretty raw from a week of wood smoke, diesel fumes, 
          dust from the streets and the two construction sites I’ve been periodically 
          helping on.  Tarps are being spread out and makeshift tables set up.   
          Only one woman is ready to sell:  oranges, peaches, green beans, etc.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">Why 
          am I here watching to Todos Santos Market come alive?   Why am I on 
          this trip?  I certainly wouldn’t trade what I’ve got for life here.  
          Is it to make me appreciate the life I have at home?  While they don’t 
          have paved streets, central heating and the environmental regulations 
          we have, families work together here, socialize, and eat together in 
          a graceful, fluid manor.  Children help unpack and sell veges, while 
          parents give them caring attention at the same time.  Standing in line 
          for a cup of coffee is a social affair for <span class=GramE>those in 
          line</span> and for those serving.  A group of 10-11 year old shoeshine 
          boys joke and laugh, and shine each other’s shoes between the few customers 
          they all share.</font></p>

          from the busloads and truckloads that have arrived over the past 2 hours.  
          The market’s mostly together but still moving slowly.  Busses and trucks 
          clog the narrow street shared by venders, shoppers, and others carting 
          boxes, bags, bins, etc.</font></p>

          bus ride.  A </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place>Toyota</st1:place></st1:City>

          in the middle of the street, not used to the grit, and hesitate to make 
          mistakes, not knowing exactly where or how to go about this.  This market 
          is not for them.  In fact, I’m not sure who it’s for as there’s a lot 
          of walking around, socializing and hefting but not many transactions 
          taking place.  It seems just a larger version of what’s here on any 
          other day:  fruits and veges, indigenous and “regular” clothes, food, 
          cassette tapes and CD’s, plastic junk, cook wear, watches and handmade 
          jewelry – a big flea market.  Lots of <span class=GramE>people selling</span> 
          the same thing too – people from the surrounding mountain pueblos taking 
          the 2, 3, 5 hour bus or truck ride here to sell their produce alongside 
          Todosanteros.  “Why this market is here” or “who it’s for” seem not 
          like legitimate questions.  “It’s what we do.” I imagine the answer 
          to be, “It’s what we’ve always done.”</font></p>

          a good day – unfolding slowly, pleasantly.  P. left for a trip up the 
          mountains with some other men here (to play a soccer game).  I took 
          a walk early before he left – to get some exercise, as Annie hasn’t 
          been too excited about hiking here.  Came back &amp; had coffee on the 
          porch with P. before he left.  Annie woke up and we went to Las Ruines 
          (the local ruins) with Magdali &amp; her 2 cousins.  Played Frisbee, 
          hide &amp; seek, &amp; I drew and studied Spanish.  Boys playing at 
          the ruins wanted to draw, so I gave them the sketchbook.  Others started 
          playing with the second Frisbee, so I gave them that &amp; was happy 
          to know the word for gift.  Sketched a donkey &amp; photo’d the girls 
          beside it.  Back home for lunch, then went to buy some candles with 
          Annie.  <span class=GramE>Am in the mood for candles.</span>  Something 
          softer in me is present today.  Have just finished playing Crazy 8’s 
          with the girls and was in need of being by myself a bit so now I’m writing.  
          Annie is happily with them today.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">The 
          beads I brought have worked out well.  The girls &amp; Estrela enjoyed 
          making jewelry together last night – a nice gift without the commercialism.  
          We have thought well about what to bring on this trip (thanks also to 
          Bob for his gifts of pencils and markers for the local school!)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Money 
          passes around here from neighbor to neighbor.  So many people sell one 
          thing or another, so many little tiendas (stores).  Living like this, 
          we could spend almost no other money (other than what we have paid the 
          school) &amp; part of me is tempted to do that, but part of me also 
          feels a drive to support the local economy.  How Flori’s household makes 
          money<span class=GramE>:Flori</span> prepares meals for the local school

          have a construction company, building houses.  Another brother is a 
          teacher in training &amp; probably isn’t making money right now.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">This 
          is a place of simple life.  Home and work overlap and flow together.  
          Family connections are strong.  There is fluidity to life here; roles 
          don’t seem to be so strict.  It is hard to tell who the children “belong 
          to”. Only when a mother is carrying a baby is it obvious, but the generations 
          are also very broad so that it took me a week to realize that Magdali 
          (13) is actually Flori’s sister, not her daughter. <span class=GramE>A 
          swirl &amp; flow of children among adults.</span>  It is frequent to 
          see children with grandparents, walking together, frequent to see toddlers

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Sounds 
          are wonderfully full here – one of the differences from home.  My walks 
          are often accompanied by music bursting from someone’s home &amp; it 
          gives me that strange feeling of being in a movie.  This morning was 
          no different and I opened my senses to the sound.  I moved from a romantic 
          love song to the chunking industrial sound of some processing of corn 
          meal which I don’t fully understand yet.  That gave way to the more 
          rhythmic clacketing of manual looms – quieter &amp; not so synchronized 
          so their rhythm formed a jerky dance.  Later on, the chanting from the 
          churches, not the church’s favored Latin, but a haunting Mam (the local 
          indigenous people) chant that we her almost daily.  It makes me wonder 
          who is really in control of these churches. </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          Annie and I are sitting on the patio, the sun shining, no smoke for 
          a change, Maria, Otto and Heremias (the 3-5 year olds) laughing and 
          playing circles around us.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">We 
          just got back from the school.  We visited a couple of classes today 
          in the main school.  <span class=GramE>853 kids, 40-70 in a class with 
          one teacher.</span>  Marguarito teaches in our language school as well 
          as at this school.  His class was really fun.  He had a great/fun control 
          over his class.  The kids sang to us, Barbara drew a map on the whiteboard 
          and we talked about where </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Guatemala</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
          was, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
          our home, etc.  We also sat through a bit of Marguarito’s lesson and 
          couldn’t quite follow it.  Something about the animals, the vitamins 
          foods contain, etc.  This was 2<sup>nd</sup> <span class=GramE>grade,</span> 
          kids were 10-11 years old.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">Last 
          night we lost power.  There were about 7 or so people watching TV, I 
          think this family having a TV is rare here.  When the power went out, 
          Annie floated the idea that we take the candles and cards to the other 
          room to see who wanted to play.  We lit two candles, brought them to 
          the kitchen and started a great game of “ochos locos” (crazy 8’s) – 
          easy to teach and play.  Annie and I, Polo, Magdali, and Elbi played 
          with several others watching and the little ones on the floor, walking 
          around or on laps.  We played a number of games for about an hour I 
          guess.  Time stood still as we had simple fun in the kitchen under candlelight 
          with the whole family.  It was nice to have the mesmerizing influence 
          of the TV gone.  It’s not on that often but the other night, while cutting 
          veges for school lunch (Flori has the job of preparing hot lunches for 
          the 850 kids at school) the TV was on – worse than US TV.  The main 
          themes were women’s breasts and a series of people’s pants falling down.  
          There were other channels but this was the top choice.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">This 
          past Sunday, I was invited to go with Elbi on an excursion for the day.  
          I understood that it was with his soccer team, up into the mountains 
          but I didn’t understand that they had a game with the tiny Aldea (smaller 
          than a village) of Shichim.  15 of us, ages 15-40 (plus or minus) got 
          into a </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:City><st1:place>Toyota</st1:place></st1:City> 
          pick up, 12 in back, and headed out of Todos Santos.  The scenery was 
          spectacular climbing out of the valley into the highest part of <st1:place>Central 
          America</st1:place>.  I couldn’t follow half of the conversation but 
          there was a ton of storytelling and laughter the whole way up.  I’m 
          guessing it was a 2+ hour drive.  It seemed the older guys were the 
          main storytellers but mostly everyone contributed – except for me and 
          perhaps 2 or three others.</font></p>

          the clouds, a bit of rain fell on us and it got pretty cold.  We passed 
          several small clusters of Mayan houses made of wood, concrete block, 
          and stone, with thatch, tin or tile roofs along the way, and arrived 
          in Shichim – a group of buildings that made Todos Santos feel like the 
          big city.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">I 
          followed along as we wandered around trying to find someone, without 
          luck, who could prepare potatoes for the 15 of us after the game.  Finally, 
          a local man volunteered to figure this out for us by the time the game 
          was over.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">The 
          field was really rough as it was covered with rocks and dished about 
          4 feet to the center.  It was cold and a really strong wind blew lengthwise 
          across the field.  It was a big surprise to me when everyone began pulling 
          out uniforms and suiting up for “the game.”  I felt a bit in a funny 
          spot – wanting to play but feeling like I should be invited if that 
          was appropriate.  The team looked to have a pretty wide range of skill 
          and that I would probably fit in o.k.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">When 
          everyone was about changed, someone said to me: “Come on, you’d better 
          change.”  “I don’t have a uniform.”  <span class=GramE>“O.K., maybe 
          the second half.”</span></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">It 
          was really fun both to watch and play.  I felt very much part of the 
          gang (“Vamos Pablo!).  During the first half, I would fetch balls that 
          the wind or a stray kick sent away from the field.  4 or 5 young boys 
          came over to check me out.  It looked like they had never seen a gringo 
          before and <span class=GramE>were</span> both excited and scared by 
          being near me.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">Playing 
          was pretty difficult.  First, I’m not a soccer player, but the wind, 
          and field conditions contributed.  The toughest part though was the 
          altitude.  At 11,000 feet, the thin air really affected my ability to 
          run.  I did manage to get into a few plays, got 2 shots off in the direction 
          of the goal and of course, we won 7 to 4.  One guy got 6 of the 7 goals.  
          At one point, he went up to head the ball and crashed into a player 
          on the other team who kept running.  He went down and was bleeding from 
          his mouth and nose and I would have guessed it to be pretty serious. 
           Several Todosanteros yelled for water but no one from Shichim moved.  
          At least half the town was there (the men) watching.  I noticed a group 
          of women with blue blankets draped over their shoulders going into or 
          coming out of a small stone church across the road from the field at 
          about mid-field.  I wasn’t sure if this lack of help was about team 
          or village loyalty or what.  It didn’t seem to me that there was any 
          tension or super-competitive vibe.  In any care, he got up, spit out 
          the blood, blew his nose and continued playing without any fanfare.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">After 
          the game, we changed, piled into the truck and drove the few hundred 
          yards back into the main part (10 or so buildings) of the Aldea to find 
          our lunch spot.  The place that had been arranged was a little room 
          in back of a concrete block building with 2 tables in a small room with 
          a bare light bulb, ready to receive us with the food we had brought 
          warmed up (tortillas and what seemed like beef) and the potatoes and 
          tea they had prepared for us.  Compared to the truck ride, it was pretty 
          quiet as we say and ate, tired and hungry.  Rain fell outside and we 
          cracked open the bottle Aguardiente (“las vitaminas”), the Guatemalan 
          version of rotgut alcohol.  Mixed with the orange juice I had brought, 
          it worked o.k.  Only a few guys drank but not to excess and many didn’t 
          drink at all.  There wasn’t any arm-twisting or expectations about it 
          and the whole experience of the day struck me as a very un-“macho” one.  
          The guys were a very friendly, fun-loving, close-knit bunch, comfortable 
          with arms around each other, sitting on laps, etc.  They were brothers, 
          cousins, co-workers, teammates, <span class=GramE>friends</span>.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">After 
          lunch, we piled back into the truck and headed out of the town - the 
          other way - down this steep set of switchbacks.  If not for the constant 
          jostling along the dirt road, there was little evidence that we were 
          on the road as, looking over the side, you looked several hundred feet 
          down over the edge.  We drove on for a while through this incredibly 
          remote high country: steep, forested cliffs and rock outcroppings.  
          Ahead was a think cloudbank, which filled the valley, mixing with the 
          trees and <span
class=GramE>cliffs.</span>  It was spectacular as we drove on into the clouds.  
          Lone houses with Barefoot Mayan families chopping wood and weaving textiles 
          dotted the landscape every mile or so.  Wow, this is a remote place.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">The 
          truck stopped along the road and we all got out <span class=GramE>to 
          explore</span> the site of a gringo’s house (“Samuel”), which was burned 
          down in the guerilla violence of the 1980’s.  The house, they said, 
          was beautiful and apparently Samuel was a great benefactor of the surrounding 
          villages.  A couple of the guys knew all about it and gave a great oration 
          with sweeping gestures.  The house site was spectacular, on the edge 
          of a steep cliff that must have been at least several hundred feet straight 
          down.  Most of the vista was shrouded in clouds.  Not being able to 
          see what was out or down there added to the mystery of the place.  At 
          one point, one of the guys called us over to the edge to point out a 
          circular rainbow straight down the cliff into the clouds as a ray of 
          sunlight penetrated from above.  Wow (again!).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">One 
          of the guys brought a camera and we took a couple of “team photos” one 
          with and one without me and we were off.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">On 
          the way home, it rained a bit and the aguardiente was poured.  We toasted 
          the team but I’d say 4 guys, not including me, did most of the drinking.  
          We got home around </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000"><st1:time Minute="30" Hour="17">5:30</st1:time>.

          of <st1:PlaceName>Todos Santos</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, we dropped 
          off a couple of guys on the edge of town and pulled onto the main street 
          to drop off the rest of us.  Polo and I walked up the street home while 
          Elbi stayed with a few others to return at about <st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="20">8 pm</st1:time> or so staggering drunk.  Polo was on one 
          arm and Flori on the other, helping him safely to bed to end a great

          are low key.  The evening meal with the family is at 8.  It’s still 
          a bit awkward for me – my Spanish isn’t quite up to it and we’re waited 
          on more than I’m comfortable with.  We eat in the kitchen which is relatively 
          small – about 10’x15’, including the wood stove.  But the fire here 
          is vented with a chimney to the outside – something I’ve come to appreciate 
          after being in other kitchens where the smoke just rises to the top 
          of the ceiling &amp; out the gap between the walls &amp; the roof.  
          The kitchen table is small &amp; only seats 4, so that’s reserved for 
          P, Annie, me &amp; Cornelius (the other American staying here).  Other 
          members of the family sit around the walls or next to the stove where 
          it’s warmer (I usually try for the chair nearest the stove).  We’ve 
          tried to invite others to the table, but usually it doesn’t work.  After 
          dinner we hang out &amp; talk for a while.  <span class=GramE>It’s</span>

        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Weaving 
          has added a new rhythm.  Last Wednesday, Annie &amp; I went to have 
          weaving lessons from Marcela, an 18 year old Mam woman. First she pulled 
          out a bag of colors &amp; told us each to pick 5.  Annie had been thinking 
          a lot about it &amp; quickly picked out a range of greens &amp; blues 
          &amp; one white.  I hadn’t thought at all about it &amp; was dazzled 
          by all the colors.  I sorted through them and came up with a red, a 
          purple, two blues and a green.  Marcela tried to get us both to choose 
          a yellow, but we both declined &amp; I realized how conservative we 
          are in colors, even when we’re trying to push ourselves into a new culture.  
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Then 
          she took us to buy the string/yarn (more like embroidery thread, really).   
          We came back to her house to wind it into balls.  After the first hour, 
          I started thinking this was all a big mistake; it would take forever 
          to do anything.  I had to regroup or give up.  So I convinced Annie 
          to let me help her wind her yarn &amp; get her started weaving – then 
          I’d think about mine.  It took us both 3 hours to wind hers – there 
          we were at the end of 3 hours of work with 5 little balls of yarn – 
          about the size of a hardball.   Annie said “I bet in the </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF"><st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
          you could buy this already in a ball.” I smiled &amp; nodded – end of 
          weaving day #1.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">(A 
          bit about Marcela, She lives in a one room, dirt floor house surrounded 
          by a cornfield &amp; flowers.  It’s an idyllic spot for us, but tight 
          for them (her mom &amp; sister).  We weave on the covered area adjacent 
          to her house.  P. tried to take pictures of the house &amp; corn, but 
          it’s all too close.  Marcela is beautiful – a combination of the natural 
          beauty of the Mam people &amp; a warm friendly spirit.  Her “personal 
          space” boundaries are far different from the American norm (at least 
          for women).  She holds &amp; hugs &amp; strokes us all the time, even 
          patted my breast on the second day to ask how long I had nursed Annie.  
          Then played with my hair and asked me why some of it was white.  She 
          loves Annie &amp; I love to see them working together. )</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Weaving 
          day #2<br>
          This morning was spent stringing the colors for the warp strings on 
          a 6’ long board with pegs in it.  Marcela showed Annie how to weave 
          the strings through the pegs, a rhythmic dance with both hands.  So 
          wonderful to see Annie <span class=GramE>pick</span> up the rhythm of 
          the movement – a whole body movement.  Six passes with each color &amp; 
          then on to the next, and so on through all the colors, then start again.  
          For another 2 hours. End of day  #2.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Weaving 
          day #3<br>
          Marcela soaked the strings in cornstarch &amp; stretched them on two 
          sticks which would end up being the end two pieces of the loom.  They 
          dried all morning but Paul, Magdali, Annie and I returned in the afternoon 
          so Marcela could show Annie how to set up the rest of the loom.  Two 
          more hours, stringing, tying – intricate, complicated work, and the 
          weaving hasn’t started yet.  We left Annie at Marcela’s, just as the 
          weaving started.  She’s comfortable there, but still brave – a new country 
          &amp; Marcela doesn’t speak any English.  I’m learning so much respect 
          for this daughter of mine on this trip.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">Weaving 
          day #4<br>
          Weaving continues &amp; Annie’s cloth is about 6” long.  The weaving 
          goes much faster at this point than I had expected, but I am still astounded 
          at the amount of work it takes.  </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000FF">So 
          I think about Marcela and the other weavers of this valley.  A very 
          intricate weaving (much more intricate than Annie’s first one) will 
          sell here for about $10-12.  It will use about $4 worth of materials 
          and take at least 10 hours of work.  And yet in front of every other 
          house there is a woman weaving – weaving fabric for the huipiles they 
          wear, weaving for the market - a beautiful, rich craft, but how long 
          will it survive like this?</font><font color="#0000FF"><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          Then, I wouldn’t have anyone to miss.  It’s a weird feeling.  I want

          Todos Santos, I met a 16 year old named Marcela.  She taught me how 
          to weave.  She lived in a one-room house with her mom and sister who 
          <span class=GramE>was</span> 14.  She loved me.  She seemed to think 
          I was so beautiful.  It’s funny, I never thought so.  And every time 
          I came, she would say, “Annie!” and run up and hug me saying to anyone 
          there, “A mi me gusta ella!” <b><i><span style='font-weight:bold;font-style:italic'>(“I 
          like her!”)</span></i></b>  When I left, I decided I wanted to give 
          her a heart of beach glass from the coast near my house.  When I gave 
          it to her, she said that whenever she looked at it she would think of 
          me.  We hugged, I cried and I left.  <u>I hate saying goodbye!</u> </font></p>

          and I realize that I miss certain luxuries like big towels and dishwashers 
          and washing machines.  Bit I feel now I could live without some I never 
          thought about.  It is good not to get stuck in thinking you need all 
          that stuff.  It’s amazing how much we have in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S</st1:place></st1:country-region><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region></font><font color="#666600"><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region></font><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region></p>
